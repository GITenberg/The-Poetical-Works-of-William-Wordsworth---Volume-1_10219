<h2><a name="introduction">Preface</a></h2>
<br>
During the decade between 1879 and 1889 I was engaged in a detailed
study of Wordsworth; and, amongst other things, edited a library edition
of his Poetical Works in eight volumes, including the "Prefaces" and
"Appendices" to his Poems, and a few others of his Prose Works, such as
his <i>Description of the Scenery of the Lakes in the North of
England</i>. This edition was published by Mr. Paterson, Edinburgh, at
intervals between the years 1882 and 1886: and it was followed in 1889
by a <i>Life of Wordsworth</i>, in three volumes, which was a
continuation of the previous eight.<br>
<br>
<a name="fr1">The</a> present edition is not a reproduction of those eleven volumes of
1882-9. It is true that to much of the editorial material included in
the latter&mdash;as well as in my <i>Memorials of Coleorton</i>, and in
<i>The English Lake District as interpreted in the Poems of
Wordsworth</i>&mdash;I can add little that is new; but the whole of what was
included in these books has been revised, corrected, and readjusted in
this one<a href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a>. <i>Errata</i> in the previous volumes are corrected:
several thousand new notes have been added, many of the old ones are
entirely recast: the changes of text, introduced by Wordsworth into the
successive editions of his Poems, have all been revised; new
readings&mdash;derived from many MS. sources&mdash;have been added: while the
chronological order of the Poems has, in several instances, been
changed, in the light of fresh evidence.<br>
<br>
The distinctive features of my edition of 1882-6 were stated in the
Preface to its first volume. So far as these features remain in the
present edition, they may be repeated as follows:

<table summary="details 1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><b>1.</b></td>
	<td>The Poems are arranged in chronological order of composition, not
of publication. In all the collective editions issued by Wordsworth
during his lifetime, the arrangement of his poems in artificial groups,
based on their leading characteristics&mdash;a plan first adopted in
1815&mdash;was adhered to; although he not unfrequently transferred a poem
from one group to another. Here they are printed, with one or two
exceptions to be afterwards explained, in the order in which they were
written.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><b>2.</b></td>
	<td>The changes of text made by Wordsworth in the successive
editions of his Poems, are given in footnotes, with the dates of the
changes.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><b>3.</b></td>
	<td>Suggested changes, written by the Poet on a copy of the
stereotyped edition of 1836-7&mdash;long kept at Rydal Mount, and bought,
after Mrs. Wordsworth's death, at the sale of a portion of the Library
at the Mount&mdash;are given in footnotes.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><b>4.</b></td>
	<td>The Notes dictated by Wordsworth to Miss Isabella Fenwick&mdash;a
dear friend of the Rydal Mount household, and a woman of remarkable
character and faculty&mdash;which tell the story of his Poems, and the
circumstances under which each was written, are printed in full.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><b>5.</b></td>
	<td>Topographical Notes&mdash;explanatory of allusions made by Wordsworth
to localities in the Lake District of England, to places in Scotland,
Somersetshire, Yorkshire, the Isle of Man, and others on the Continent
of Europe&mdash;are given, either at the close of the Poem in which the
allusions occur, or as footnotes to the passages they illustrate.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><b>6.</b></td>
	<td>Several complete Poems, and other fragments of verse, not
included in any edition of his Works published during Wordsworth's
lifetime, or since, are printed as an appendix to Volume VIII.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><b>7.</b></td>
	<td>A new Bibliography of the Poems and Prose Works, and of the
several editions issued in England and America, from 1793 to 1850, is
added.</td>

These features of the edition of 1882-6 are preserved in that of 1896,
and the following are added:

<table summary="details 2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><b>1.</b></td>
	<td>The volumes are published, not in library 8vo size, but&mdash;as the
works of every poet should be issued&mdash;in one more convenient to handle,
and to carry. Eight volumes are devoted to the Poetical Works, and among
them are included those fragments by his sister Dorothy, and others,
which Wordsworth published in his lifetime among his own Poems. They are
printed in the chronological order of composition, so far as that is
known.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><b>2,</b></td>
	<td>In the case of each Poem, any Note written by Wordsworth
himself, as explanatory of it, comes first, and has the initials W. W.,
with the date of its first insertion placed after it. Next follows the
Fenwick Note, within square brackets, thus [ ], and signed I. F.; and,
afterwards, any editorial note required. When, however, Wordsworth's own
notes were placed at the end of the Poems, or at the foot of the page,
his plan is adopted, and the date appended. I should have been glad, had
it been possible&mdash;the editors of the twentieth century may note this&mdash;to
print Wordsworth's own notes, <span style="color: #555555;">the Fenwick notes</span>, and <span style="color: #777777;">the Editor's</span> in
different type, and in type of a decreasing size; but the idea occurred
to me too late, <i>i.e</i>. after the first volume had been passed for
press. [Note: in pursuance of this aim, I have displayed the notes as above: Wordsworth's in black type, the Fenwick notes in <span style="color: #555555;">dark grey</span>, and the editor's own notes in <span style="color: #777777;">light grey</span>. I have not decreased the size, which would have made the text more difficult to read! html Ed.]

the Poems, in two volumes. The Prose Works were collected by Dr.
Grosart, and published in 1876. Extracts from them have since been

Poems, in chronological order, under their own titles, and with such
notes as seem desirable.</td>

curtailed will be found in the editorial note preceding it. Much new

	<td>The Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth &mdash;with a few from
Mary and Dora Wordsworth&mdash;are arranged chronologically, and published by
themselves. Hitherto, these letters have been scattered in many
quarters&mdash;in the late Bishop of Lincoln's <i>Memoirs</i> of his uncle,
in <i>The Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence of Henry Crabb
Robinson</i>, in the <i>Memorials of Coleorton</i> and my own
<i>Life</i> of the Poet, in the <i>Prose Works</i>, in the
<i>Transactions of the Wordsworth Society</i>, in the <i>Letters of
Charles Lamb</i>, in the <i>Memorials of Thomas De Quincey</i>, and
other volumes; but many more, both of Wordsworth's and his sister's,
have never before seen the light. More than a hundred and fifty letters
from Dorothy Wordsworth to Mrs. Clarkson, the wife of the great
"slave-liberator," were sent to me some time ago by Mrs. Arthur
Tennyson, a relative of Mrs. Clarkson; and I have recently seen and been
allowed to copy, Wordsworth's letters to his early friend Francis
Wrangham, through the kindness of their late owner, Mr. Mackay of The
Grange, Trowbridge. Many other letters of great interest have recently
reached me.</td>

the Poems, and the Prose Works, a Bibliography of Wordsworth Criticism
is appended. It includes most of the articles on the Poet, and notices
of his Works, which have appeared in Great Britain, America, and the
Continent of Europe. Under this head I have specially to thank Mrs.
Henry A. St. John of Ithaca, N.Y., a devoted Transatlantic
Wordsworthian, who has perhaps done more than any one&mdash;since Henry
Reed&mdash;to promote the study of her favourite poet in America. Mrs. St.
John's Wordsworth collection is unique, and her knowledge and enthusiasm
are as great as her industry has been. Professor E. Legouis of the
University of Lyons&mdash;who wrote an interesting book on Wordsworth's
friend, <i>Le Général Michel Beaupuy</i> (1891)&mdash;has sent me material
from France, which will be found in its proper place. Frau Professor
Gothein of Bonn, who has translated many of Wordsworth's poems into
German, and written his life, <i>William Wordsworth: sein Leben, seine
Werke, seine Zeitgenossen</i>, (1893), has similarly helped me in
reference to German criticism.</td>

C. O. Murray. One portrait by Haydon was prefixed to the first volume of
the <i>Life</i>. In each volume of this edition&mdash;Poems, Prose Works,
Journals, Letters, and Life&mdash;there will be a new portrait, either of the
poet, or his wife, or sister, or daughter; and also a small vignette of
a place associated with, or memorialised by Wordsworth in some way. The

All the etchings will be prepared by H. Manesse. The portraits, with
many others, will be described in detail in a subsequent volume.<br>
<br>
In all editorial notes the titles given by Wordsworth to his Poems are
invariably printed in italics, not with inverted commas before and
after, as Wordsworth himself so often printed them: and when he gave no
title to a poem, its first line will be invariably placed within
inverted commas. This plan of using Italics, and not Roman letters,
applies also to the title of any book referred to by Wordsworth, or by
his sister in her Journals. Whether they put the title in italics, or
within commas, it is always <i>italicised</i> in this edition.<br>
<br>
A subsidiary matter such as this becomes important when one finds that
many editors of parts of the Works of Wordsworth, or of Selections from
them, have invented titles of their own; and have sent their volumes to
press without the slightest indication to their readers that the titles
were not Wordsworth's; mixing up their own notion of what best described
the contents of the Poem, or the Letter, with those of the writer. Some
have suppressed Wordsworth's, and put their own title in its place!
Others have contented themselves (more modestly) with inventing a title
when Wordsworth gave none. I do not object to these titles in
themselves. Several, such as those by Archbishop Trench, are suggestive
and valuable. What I object to is that any editor&mdash;no matter who&mdash;should
mingle his own titles with those of the Poet, and give no indication to
the reader as to which is which. Dr. Grosart has been so devoted a
student of Wordsworth, and we owe him so much, that one regrets to find
in "The Prose Works of Wordsworth" (1876) the following title given to
his letter to the Bishop of Llandaff, <i>Apology for the French
Revolution</i>. It is interesting to know that Dr. Grosart thought this
a useful description of the letter: but a clear indication should have
been given that it was not Wordsworth's. It is true that, in the general
preface to his volumes, Dr. Grosart takes upon himself the
responsibility for this title; but it should not have been printed as
the title in chief, or as the headline to the text. Similarly, with the
titles of the second and third of the three <i>Essays on Epitaphs</i>.<br>
<br>
As students of Wordsworth know, he issued a volume in 1838 containing
all his sonnets then written; and, at the close of that edition, he
added, "The six Sonnets annexed were composed as this Volume was going
through the Press, but too late for insertion in the class of
miscellaneous ones to which they belong." In 1884, Archbishop Trench
edited the sonnets, with an admirable introductory "Essay on the History
of the English Sonnet"; but, while Wordsworth gave no title to the 3rd
and the 4th of the six, "composed as the Volume was going through the
Press,"&mdash;either in his edition of 1838, <i>or in any subsequent
issue</i> of his Poems&mdash;his editor did so. He gave what are really
excellent titles, but he does not tell us that they are his own! He
calls them respectively <i>The Thrush at Twilight</i>, and <i>The Thrush
at Dawn</i>. Possibly Wordsworth would have approved of both of those
titles: but, that they are not his, should have been indicated.<br>
<br>
I do not think it wise, from an editorial point of view, even to print
in a "Chronological Table"&mdash;as Professor Dowden has done, in his
admirable Aldine edition&mdash;titles which were not Wordsworth's, without
some indication to that effect. But, in the case of Selections from
Wordsworth&mdash;such as those of Mr. Hawes Turner, and Mr. A. J.
Symington,&mdash;every one must feel that the editor should have informed his
readers <i>when</i> the title was Wordsworth's, and <i>when</i> it was
his own coinage. In the case of a much greater man&mdash;and one of
Wordsworth's most illustrious successors in the great hierarchy of
English poesy, Matthew Arnold&mdash;it may be asked why should he have put
<i>Margaret, or the Ruined Cottage</i>, as the title of a poem written
in 1795-7, when Wordsworth never once published it under that name? It
was an extract from the first book of <i>The Excursion</i>&mdash;written, it
is true, in these early years,&mdash;but only issued as part of the latter
poem, first published in 1814.<br>
<br>
The question of the number, the character, and the length of the Notes,
which a wise editor should append to the works of a great poet, (or to
any classic), is perhaps still <i>sub judice</i>. My own opinion is
that, in all editorial work, the notes should be illustrative rather
than critical; and that they should only bring out those points, which
the ordinary reader of the text would not readily understand, if the
poems were not annotated. For this reason, topographical, historical,
and antiquarian notes are almost essential. The Notes which Wordsworth
himself wrote to his Poems, are of unequal length and merit. It was
perhaps necessary for him to write&mdash;at all events it is easy to
understand, and to sympathise with, his writing&mdash;the long note on the
revered parson of the Duddon Valley, the Rev. Robert Walker, who will be
remembered for many generations as the "Wonderful Walker." The Poet's
editors have also been occasionally led to add digressive notes, to
clear up points which had been left by himself either dubious, or
obscure. I must plead guilty to the charge of doing so: e.g. the
identification of "The Muccawiss" (see <i>The Excursion</i>, book iii.
l. 953) with the Whip-poor-Will involved a great deal of laborious
correspondence years ago. It was a question of real difficulty; and,
although the result reached could now be put into two or three lines, I
have thought it desirable that the opinions of those who wrote about it,
and helped toward the solution, should be recorded. What I print is only
a small part of the correspondence that took place.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, it would be quite out of place, in a note to the
famous passage in the 4th book of <i>The Excursion</i>, beginning

<blockquote>... I have seen<br>
A curious child applying to his ear</blockquote>

to enter on a discussion as to the extent of Wordsworth's debt&mdash;if
any&mdash;to the author of <i>Gebir</i>. It is quite sufficient to print the
relative passage from Landor's poem at the foot of the page.<br>
<br>
All the Notes written by Wordsworth himself in his numerous editions
will be found in this one, with the date of their first appearance
added. Slight textual changes, however, or casual <i>addenda</i>, are
not indicated, unless they are sufficiently important. Changes in the
text of notes have not the same importance to posterity, as changes in
the text of poems. In the preface to the Prose Works, reference will be
made to Wordsworth's alterations of his text. At present I refer only to
his own notes to his Poems. When they were written as footnotes to the
page, they remain footnotes still. When they were placed by him as
prefaces to his Poems, they retain that place in this edition; but when
they were appendix notes&mdash;as e.g. in the early editions of "Lyrical
Ballads"&mdash;they are now made footnotes to the Poems they illustrate. In
such a case, however, as the elaborate note to <i>The Excursion</i>,
containing a reprint of the <i>Essay upon Epitaphs</i>&mdash;originally
contributed to "The Friend"&mdash;it is transferred to the Prose Works, to
which it belongs by priority of date; and, as it would be inexpedient to
print it twice over, it is omitted from the notes to <i>The
Excursion</i>.<br>
<br>
As to the place which Notes to a poet's works should occupy, there is no
doubt that numerous and lengthy ones&mdash;however valuable, or even
necessary, by way of illustration,&mdash;disfigure the printed page; and some
prefer that they should be thrown all together at the end of each
volume, or at the close of a series; such as&mdash;in Wordsworth's case&mdash;"The
River Duddon," "Ecclesiastical Sonnets," <i>The Prelude</i>, <i>The
White Doe of Rylstone</i>, etc. I do not think, however, that many care
to turn repeatedly to the close of a series of poems, or the end of a
volume, to find an explanatory note, helped only by an index number, and
when perhaps even that does not meet his eye at the foot of the page. I
do not find that even ardent Wordsworth students like to search for
notes in "appendices"; and perhaps the more ardent they are the less
desirable is it for them thus "to hunt the waterfalls."<br>
<br>
I have the greatest admiration for the work which Professor Dowden has
done in his edition of Wordsworth; but the <i>plan</i> which he has
followed, in his Aldine edition, of giving not only the Fenwick Notes,
but all the changes of text introduced by Wordsworth into his successive
editions, in additional editorial notes at the end of each volume&mdash;to
understand which the reader must turn the pages repeatedly, from text to
note and note to text, forwards and backwards, at times
distractingly&mdash;is for practical purposes almost unworkable. The reader
who examines Notes <i>critically</i> is ever "one among a thousand,"
even if they are printed at the foot of the page, and meet the eye
readily. If they are consigned to the realm of <i>addenda</i> they will
be read by very few, and studied by fewer.<br>
<br>
To those who object to Notes being "thrust into view" (as it must be
admitted that they are in this edition)&mdash;because it disturbs the
pleasure of the reader who cares for the poetry of Wordsworth, and for
the poetry alone&mdash;I may ask how many persons have read the Fenwick
Notes, given together in a series, and mixed up heterogeneously with
Wordsworth's own Notes to his poems, in comparison with those who have
read and enjoyed them in the editions of 1857 and 1863? Professor Dowden
justifies his plan of relegating the Fenwick and other notes to the end
of each volume of his edition, on the ground that students of the Poet
<i>must</i> take the trouble of hunting to and fro for such things. I
greatly doubt if many who have read and profited&mdash;for they could not but
profit&mdash;by a perusal of Professor Dowden's work, <i>have</i> taken that
trouble, or that future readers of the Aldine edition will take it.<br>

	<td><b>As to the <i>Chronological Order</i> of the Poems.</b><br>
	<br>
	The chief advantage of a chronological arrangement of the Works of any
author&mdash;and especially of a poet who himself adopted a different
plan&mdash;is that it shows us, as nothing else can do, the growth of his own
mind, the progressive development of his genius and imaginative power.
By such a redistribution of what he wrote we can trace the rise, the
culmination, and also&mdash;it may be&mdash;the decline and fall of his genius.
Wordsworth's own arrangement&mdash;first adopted in the edition of 1815&mdash;was
designed by him, with the view of bringing together, in separate
classes, those Poems which referred to the same (or similar) subjects,
or which were supposed to be the product of the same (or a similar)
faculty, irrespective of the date of composition. Thus one group was
entitled "Poems of the Fancy," another "Poems of the Imagination," a
third "Poems proceeding from Sentiment and Reflection," a fourth
"Epitaphs and Elegiac Pieces," again "Poems on the Naming of Places,"
"Memorials of Tours," "Ecclesiastical Sonnets," "Miscellaneous Sonnets,"
etc. The principle which guided him in this was obvious enough. It was,
in some respects, a most natural arrangement; and, in now adopting a
chronological order, the groups, which he constructed with so much care,
are broken up. Probably every author would attach more importance to a
classification of his Works, which brought them together under
appropriate headings, irrespective of date, than to a method of
arrangement which exhibited the growth of his own mind; and it may be
taken for granted that posterity would not think highly of any author
who attached special value to this latter element. None the less
posterity may wish to trace the gradual development of genius, in the
imaginative writers of the past, by the help of such a subsequent
rearrangement of their Works.<br>
<br>
There are difficulties, however, in the way of such a rearrangement,
some of which, in Wordsworth's case, cannot be entirely surmounted. In
the case of itinerary Sonnets, referring to the same subject, the
dismemberment of a series&mdash;carefully arranged by their author&mdash;seems to
be specially unnatural. But Wordsworth himself sanctioned the principle.
If there was a fitness in collecting all his sonnets in one volume in
the year 1838, out of deference to the wishes of his friends, in order
that these poems might be "brought under the eye at once"&mdash;thus removing
them from their original places, in his collected works&mdash;it seems
equally fitting now to rearrange them chronologically, as far as it is
possible to do so. It will be seen that it is not always possible.<br>
<br>
Then, there is the case of two Poems following each other, in
Wordsworth's own arrangement, by natural affinity; such as the
<i>Epistle to Sir George Beaumont</i>, written in 1811, which in almost
all existing editions is followed by the Poem written in 1841, and
entitled, <i>Upon perusing the foregoing Epistle thirty years after its
composition</i>; or, the dedication to <i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i>,
written in April 1815, while the Poem itself was written in 1807. To
separate these Poems seems unnatural; and, as it would be inadmissible
to print the second of the two twice over&mdash;once as a sequel to the first
poem, and again in its chronological place&mdash;adherence to the latter plan
has its obvious disadvantage in the case of these poems.<br>
<br>
Mr. Aubrey de Vere is very desirous that I should arrange all the "Poems
dedicated to National Independence and Liberty" together in series, as
Wordsworth left them, "on the principle that, though the order of
publication should as a rule be the order of composition in poetry, all
rules require, as well as admit of, exceptions." As I have the greatest
respect for the judgment of such an authority as Mr. de Vere, I may
explain that I only venture to differ from him because there are
seventy-four Poems&mdash;including the sonnets and odes&mdash;in this series, and
because they cover a period ranging from 1802 to 1815. I am glad,
however, that many of these sonnets can be printed together, especially
the earlier ones of 1802.<br>
<br>
After carefully weighing every consideration, it has seemed to me
desirable to adopt the chronological arrangement in this particular
edition; in which an attempt is made to trace the growth of Wordsworth's
genius, as it is unfolded in his successive works. His own arrangement
of his Poems will always possess a special interest and value; and it is
not likely ever to be entirely superseded in subsequent issues of his
Works. The editors and publishers of the future may possibly prefer it
to the plan now adopted, and it will commend itself to many readers from
the mere fact that <i>it was Wordsworth's own</i>; but in an edition
such as the present&mdash;which is meant to supply material for the study of
the Poet to those who may not possess, or have access to, the earlier
and rarer editions&mdash;no method of arrangement can be so good as the
chronological one. Its importance will be obvious after several volumes
are published, when the point referred to above&mdash;viz. the evolution of
the poet's genius&mdash;will be shown by the very sequence of the subjects
chosen, and their method of treatment from year to year.<br>
<br>
The date of the composition of Wordsworth's Poems cannot always be
ascertained with accuracy: and to get at the chronological order, it is
not sufficient to take up his earlier volumes, and thereafter to note
the additions made in subsequent ones. We now know (approximately) when
each poem was first published; although, in some instances, they
appeared in newspapers and magazines, and in many cases publication was
long after the date of composition. For example, <i>Guilt and Sorrow;
or, Incidents upon Salisbury Plain</i>&mdash;written in the years
1791-94&mdash;was not published <i>in extenso</i> till 1842. The tragedy of
<i>The Borderers</i>, composed in 1795-96, was also first published in
1842. <i>The Prelude</i>&mdash;"commenced in the beginning of the year 1799,
and completed in the summer of 1805"&mdash;was published posthumously in
1850: and some unpublished poems&mdash;both "of early and late years"&mdash;were
first issued in 1886. A poem was frequently kept back, from some doubt
as to its worth, or from a wish to alter and amend it. Of the five or
six hundred sonnets that he wrote, Wordsworth said "Most of them were
frequently re-touched; and, not a few, laboriously." Some poems were
almost entirely recast; and occasionally fugitive verses were withheld
from publication for a time, because it was hoped that they would
subsequently form part of a larger whole.<br>
<br>
In the case of many of the poems, we are left to conjecture the date of
composition, although we are seldom without some clue to it. The Fenwick
Notes are a great assistance in determining the chronology. These
notes&mdash;which will be afterwards more fully referred to&mdash;were dictated by
Wordsworth to Miss Fenwick in the year 1843; but, at that time, his
memory could not be absolutely trusted as to dates; and in some
instances we know it to have been at fault. For example, he said of
<i>The Old Cumberland Beggar</i> that it was "written at Racedown and
Alfoxden in my twenty-third year." Now, he went to Racedown in the
autumn of 1795, when he was twenty-five years old; and to Alfoxden, in
the autumn of 1797, when twenty-seven. Again, the poem <i>Rural
Architecture</i> is put down in the Fenwick note as "written at Townend
in 1801"; but it had been published in 1800, in the second edition of
"Lyrical Ballads." Similarly Wordsworth gave the dates "1801 or 1802"
for <i>The Reverie of Poor Susan</i>, which had also appeared in
"Lyrical Ballads," 1800.<br>
<br>
Wordsworth's memory was not always to be trusted even when he was
speaking of a group of his own Poems. For example, in the edition of
1807, there is a short series described thus, "Poems, composed during a
tour, chiefly on foot." They are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Now, one would
naturally suppose that all the poems, in this set of five, were composed
during the same pedestrian tour, and that they all referred to the same
time. But the series contains <i>Alice Fell</i> (1802), <i>Beggars</i>
(1802), <i>To a Sky-Lark</i> (1805), and <i>Resolution and
Independence</i> (1802).<br>
<br>
Much more valuable than the Fenwick notes&mdash;for a certain portion of
Wordsworth's life&mdash;is his sister Dorothy's Journal. The mistakes in the
former can frequently be corrected from the minutely kept diary of those
early years, when the brother and sister lived together at Grasmere. The
whole of that Journal, so far as it is desirable to print it for
posterity, will be given in a subsequent volume.<br>
<br>
Long before the publication of the Fenwick notes, Wordsworth himself
supplied some data for a chronological arrangement of his Works. In the
table of contents, prefixed to the first collected edition of 1815, in
two volumes,&mdash;and also to the second collected edition of 1820, in four
volumes,&mdash;there are two parallel columns: one giving the date of
composition, and the other that of publication. There are numerous
blanks in the former column, which was the only important one; as the
year of publication could be ascertained from the editions themselves.
Sometimes the date is given vaguely; as in the case of the "Sonnets
dedicated to Liberty," where the note runs, "from the year 1807 to
1813." At other times, the entry of the year of publication is
inaccurate; for example, the <i>Inscription for the spot where the
Hermitage stood on St. Herbert's Island, Derwentwater</i>, is put down
as belonging to the year 1807; but this poem does not occur in the
volumes of 1807, but in the second volume of "Lyrical Ballads" (1800).
It will thus be seen that it is only by comparing Wordsworth's own lists
of the years to which his Poems belong, with the contents of the several
editions of his Works, with the Fenwick Notes, and with his sister's
Journal, that we can approximately reconstruct the true chronology. To
these sources of information must be added the internal evidence of the
Poems themselves, incidental references in letters to friends, and stray
hints gathered from various quarters.<br>
<br>
Many new sources of information as to the date of the composition of the
Poems became known to me during the publication of my previous edition,
and after its issue; the most important being the Journals of Dorothy
Wordsworth. These discoveries showed that my chronological table of
1882&mdash;although then, relatively, "up to date"&mdash;was incomplete. The
tables constructed by Mr. Tutin and by Professor Dowden are both more
accurate than it was. It is impossible to attain to finality in such a
matter; and several facts, afterwards discovered, and mentioned in the
later volumes of my previous edition, have been used against the
conclusions come to in the earlier ones. I have thus supplied the
feathers for a few subsequent critical arrows. The shots have not been
unkindly ones; and I am glad of the result, viz. that our knowledge of
the dates&mdash;both as to the composition and first publication of the poems
&mdash;is now much more exact than before. When a conjectural one is given in
this edition, the fact is always mentioned.<br>
<br>
This chronological method of arrangement, however, has its limits. It is
not possible always to adopt it: nor is it invariably <i>necessary</i>,
even in order to obtain a true view of the growth of Wordsworth's mind.
In this&mdash;as in so many other things&mdash;wisdom lies in the avoidance of
extremes; the extreme of rigid fidelity to the order of time on the one
hand, and the extreme of an irrational departure from it on the other.
While an effort has been made to discover the exact order of the
composition of the poems&mdash;and this is shown, not only in the
Chronological Table, but at the beginning of each separate poem&mdash;it has
been considered expedient to depart from that order in printing some of
the poems. In certain cases a poem was begun and laid aside, and again
resumed at intervals; and it is difficult to know to what year the
larger part of it should be assigned. When we know the date at which a
poem was commenced, and that it was finished "long afterwards," but have
no clue as to the year, it is assigned to the year in which it was
begun. For example, the <i>Address to Kilchurn Castle</i> was begun in
1803, but only the first three lines were written then. Wordsworth tells
us that "the rest was added many years after," but when we know not; and
the poem was not published till 1827. In such a case, it is placed in
this edition as if it belonged chronologically to 1803, and retains its
place in the series of Poems which memorialise the Tour in Scotland of
that year. On a similar principle, <i>The Highland Girl</i> is placed in
the same series; although Dorothy Wordsworth tells us, in her Journal of
the Tour, that it was composed "not long after our return from
Scotland"; and <i>Glen Almain</i>&mdash;although written afterwards at
Rydal&mdash;retains its published place in the memorial group. Again the
<i>Departure from the Vale of Grasmere, August 1803</i>, is prefixed to
the same series; although it was not written till 1811, and first
published in 1827. To give symmetry to such a Series, it is necessary to
depart from the exact chronological order&mdash;the departure being duly
indicated.<br>
<br>
On the same principle I have followed the <i>Address to the Scholars of
the Village School of &mdash;&mdash;</i>, by its natural sequel&mdash;<i>By the Side of
the Grave some Years after</i>, the date of the composition of which is
unknown: and the <i>Epistle to Sir George Beaumont</i> (1811) is
followed by the later Lines, to which Wordsworth gave the most prosaic
title&mdash;he was often infelicitous in his titles&mdash;<i>Upon perusing the
foregoing Epistle thirty years after its composition</i>. A like remark
applies to the poem <i>Beggars</i>, which is followed by its own
<i>Sequel</i>, although the order of date is disturbed; while all the
"Epitaphs," translated from Chiabrera, are printed together.<br>
<br>
It is manifestly appropriate that the poems belonging to a series&mdash;such
as the "Ecclesiastical Sonnets," or those referring to the
"Duddon"&mdash;should be brought together, as Wordsworth finally arranged
them; even although we may be aware that some of them were written
subsequently, and placed in the middle of the series. The sonnets
referring to "Aspects of Christianity in America"&mdash;inserted in the 1845
and 1849-50 editions of the collected Works&mdash;are found in no previous
edition or version of the "Ecclesiastical Sonnets." <a name="fr2">These</a>, along with
some others on the Offices of the English Liturgy, were suggested to
Wordsworth by an American prelate, Bishop Doane, and by Professor Henry
Reed<a href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a>; but we do not know in what year they were written. The
"Ecclesiastical Sonnets"&mdash;first called "Ecclesiastical Sketches"&mdash;were
written in the years 1820-22. The above additions to them appeared
twenty-five years afterwards; but they ought manifestly to retain their
place, as arranged by Wordsworth in the edition of 1845. The case is
much the same with regard to the "Duddon Sonnets." They were first
published in 1820: but No. xiv. beginning:

<blockquote>O mountain Stream! the Shepherd and his Cot,</blockquote>

was written in the year 1806, and appears in the edition of 1807. This
sonnet will be printed in the series to which it belongs, and not in its
chronological place. I <a name="fr3">think</a> it would be equally unjust to remove it
from the group&mdash;in which it helps to form a unity&mdash;and to print it twice
over<a href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a>. On the other hand, the series of "Poems composed during a Tour
in Scotland, and on the English Border, in the Autumn of 1831"&mdash;and
first published in the year 1835, in the volume entitled "Yarrow
Revisited, and Other Poems"&mdash;contains two, which Wordsworth himself
tells us were composed earlier; and there is no reason why these poems
should not be restored to their chronological place. The series of
itinerary sonnets, published along with them in the Yarrow volume of
1835, is the record of another Scottish tour, taken in the year 1833;
and Wordsworth says of them that they were "composed <i>or suggested</i>
during a tour in the summer of 1833." We cannot now discover which of
them were written during the tour, and which at Rydal Mount after his
return; but it is obvious that they should be printed in the order in
which they were left by him, in 1835. It may be noted that almost all
the "Evening Voluntaries" belong to these years&mdash;1832 to 1835&mdash;when the
author was from sixty-two to sixty-five years of age.<br>
<br>
Wordsworth's habit of revision may perhaps explain the mistakes into
which he occasionally fell as to the dates of his Poems, and the
difficulty of reconciling what he says, as to the year of composition,
with the date assigned by his sister in her Journal. When he says
"written in 1801, or 1802," he may be referring to the last revision
which he gave to his work. Certain it is, however, that he sometimes
gave a date for the composition, which was subsequent to the publication
of the poem in question.<br>
<br>
In the case of those poems to which no date was attached, I have tried
to find a clue by which to fix an approximate one. Obviously, it would
not do to place all the undated poems in a class by themselves. Such an
arrangement would be thoroughly artificial; and, while we are in many
instances left to conjecture, we can always say that such and such a
poem was composed not later than a particular year. When the precise
date is undiscoverable, I have thought it best to place the poem in or
immediately before the year in which it was first published.<br>
<br>
Poems which were several years in process of composition, having been
laid aside, and taken up repeatedly; <i>e.g. The Prelude</i>, which was
composed between the years 1799 and 1805&mdash;are placed in the year in
which they were finished. Disputable questions as to the date of any
poem are dealt with in the editorial note prefixed or appended to it.<br>
<br>
There is one Poem which I have intentionally placed out of its
chronological place, viz. the <i>Ode, Intimations of Immortality from
Recollections of Early Childhood</i>. It was written at intervals from
1803 to 1806, and was first published in the edition of 1807, where it
stood at the end of the second volume. In every subsequent edition of
the collected Works&mdash;1815 to 1850&mdash;it closed the groups of poems; <i>The
Excursion</i> only following it, in a volume of its own. This was an
arrangement made by Wordsworth, of set purpose, and steadily adhered
to&mdash;the <i>Ode</i> forming as it were the High Altar of his poetic
Cathedral. As he wished it to retain that place in subsequent editions
of his Works, it retains it in this one.<br>
<br>
Mr. <a name="fr4">Arnold's</a> arrangement of the Poems, in his volume of Selections<a href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a>,
is extremely interesting and valuable; but, as to the method of grouping
adopted, I am not sure that it is better than Wordsworth's own. As a
descriptive title, "Poems of Sentiment and Reflection" is quite as good
as "Poems akin to the Antique," and "Poems of the Fancy" quite as
appropriate as "Poems of Ballad Form."<br>
<br>
Wordsworth's arrangement of his Poems in groups was psychologically very
interesting; but it is open to many objections. Unfortunately Wordsworth
was not himself consistent&mdash;in the various editions issued by
himself&mdash;either in the class into which he relegated each poem, or the
order in which he placed it there. There is tantalising topsy-turvyism
in this, so that an editor who adopts it is almost compelled to select
Wordsworth's latest grouping, which was not always his best.<br>
<br>
Sir William Rowan Hamilton wrote to Mr. Aubrey de Vere in 1835 that Dora
Wordsworth told him that her father "was sometimes at a loss whether to
refer her to the 'Poems of the Imagination,' or the 'Poems of the
Fancy,' for some particular passage." <a name="fr5">Aubrey</a> de Vere himself considered
Wordsworth's arrangement as "a parade of system," and wrote of it, "I
cannot help thinking that in it, he mistakes classification for method."<a href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> I confess that it is often difficult to see why some of the poems
were assigned by their author to the realm of the "Fancy," the
"Imagination," and "Sentiment and Reflection" respectively. In a note to
<i>The Horn of Egremont Castle</i> (edition 1815) Wordsworth speaks of
it as "referring to the imagination," rather than as being "produced by
it"; and says that he would not have placed it amongst his "Poems of the
Imagination," "but to avoid a needless multiplication of classes"; and
in the editions of 1827 and 1832 he actually included the great
<i>Ode</i> on Immortality among his "Epitaphs and Elegiac Poems"! As
late as 27th September 1845, he wrote to Professor Henry Reed,

<blockquote>"Following your example" (<i>i.e</i>. the example set in Reed's American
edition of the Poems), "I have greatly extended the class entitled
'Poems of the Imagination,' thinking as you must have done that, if
Imagination were predominant in the class, it was not indispensable that
it should pervade every poem which it contained. Limiting the class as I
had done before, seemed to imply, and to the uncandid or observing did
so, that the faculty, which is the <i>primum mobile</i> in poetry, had
little to do, in the estimation of the author, with pieces not arranged
under that head. I therefore feel much obliged to you for suggesting by
your practice the plan which I have adopted."</blockquote>

Could anything show more explicitly than this that Wordsworth was not
perfectly satisfied with his own artificial groups? <a name="fr6">Professor</a> Reed, in
his American edition of 1837, however, acted on Wordsworth's expressed
intention of distributing the contents of "Yarrow Revisited, and Other
Poems" amongst the classes. He tells us that he "interspersed the
contents of this volume among the Poems already arranged" by Wordsworth<a href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
It may also be mentioned that not only members of his own household, but
many of Wordsworth's friends&mdash;notably Charles Lamb&mdash;expressed a
preference for a different arrangement of his Poems from that which he
had adopted.</td>

	<td><b>The various Readings, or variations of text,</b><br>
	<br>made by Wordsworth
during his lifetime, or written by him on copies of his Poems, or
discovered in MS. letters, from himself, or his sister, or his wife, are
given in footnotes in this edition. Few English poets changed their text
more frequently, or with more fastidiousness, than Wordsworth did. He
did not always alter it for the better. Every alteration however, which
has been discovered by me, whether for the better or for the worse, is
here printed in full. We <a name="fr7">have</a> thus a record of the fluctuations of his
own mind as to the form in which he wished his Poems to appear; and this
record casts considerable light on the development of his genius<a href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
A knowledge of these changes of text can only be obtained in one or
other of two ways. Either the reader must have access to all the
thirty-two editions of Poems, the publication of which Wordsworth
personally supervised; or, he must have all the changes in the
successive editions, exhibited in the form of footnotes, and appended to
the particular text that is selected and printed in the body of the
work. It is extremely difficult&mdash;in some cases quite impossible&mdash;to
obtain the early editions. <a name="fr8">The</a> great public libraries of the country do
not possess them all<a href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a>. It is therefore necessary to fall back upon the
latter plan, which seems the only one by which a knowledge of the
changes of the text can be made accessible, either to the general
reader, or to the special student of English Poetry.<br>
<br>
The <a name="fr9">text</a> which&mdash;after much consideration&mdash;I have resolved to place
throughout, in the body of the work, is Wordsworth's own final <i>textus
receptus</i>, i.e. the text of 1849-50, reproduced in the posthumous
edition of 1857<a href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a>; and since opinion will doubtless differ as to the
wisdom of this selection, it may be desirable to state at some length
the reasons which have led me to adopt it.<br>
<br>
There are only three possible courses open to an editor, who wishes to
give&mdash;along with the text selected&mdash;all the various readings
chronologically arranged as footnotes. Either,
<ol type="1">
<li>the earliest text may be taken, or</li>
<li>the latest may be chosen, or </li>
<li>the text may be
selected from different editions, so as to present each poem in its best
state (according to the judgment of the editor), in whatever edition it
is found.</li>
</ol>
 A composite text, made up from two or more editions, would be
inadmissible.<br>
<br>
Now, most persons who have studied the subject know that Wordsworth's
best text is to be found, in one poem in its earliest edition, in
another in its latest, and in a third in some intermediate edition. I
cannot agree either with the statement that he always altered for the
worse, or that he always altered for the better. His critical judgment
was not nearly so unerring in this respect as Coleridge's was, or as
Tennyson's has been. It may be difficult, therefore, to assign an
altogether satisfactory reason for adopting either the earliest or the
latest text; and at first sight, the remaining alternative plan may seem
the wisest of the three. There are indeed difficulties in the way of the
adoption of any one of the methods suggested; and as I adopt the latest
text&mdash;not because it is always intrinsically the best, but on other
grounds to be immediately stated&mdash;it may clear the way, if reference be
made in the first instance to the others, and to the reasons for
abandoning them.<br>
<br>
As to a selection of the text from various editions, this would
doubtless be the best plan, were it a practicable one; and perhaps it
may be attainable some day. But Wordsworth is as yet too near us for
such an editorial treatment of his Works to be successful. The
fundamental objection to it is that scarcely two minds&mdash;even among the
most competent of contemporary judges&mdash;will agree as to what the best
text is. An edition arranged on this principle could not possibly be
acceptable to more than a few persons. Of course no arrangement of any
kind can escape adverse criticism: it would be most unfortunate if it
did. But this particular edition would fail in its main purpose, if
questions of individual taste were made primary, and not secondary; and
an arrangement, which gave scope for the arbitrary selection of
particular texts,&mdash;according to the wisdom, or the want of wisdom, of
the editor,&mdash;would deservedly meet with severe criticism in many
quarters. Besides, such a method of arrangement would not indicate the
growth of the Poet's mind, and the development of his genius. If an
editor wished to indicate his own opinion of the best text for each
poem&mdash;under the idea that his judgment might be of some use to other
people&mdash;it would be wiser to do so by means of some mark or marginal
note, than by printing his selected text in the main body of the work.
He could thus at once preserve the chronological order of the readings,
indicate his own preference, and leave it to others to select what they
preferred. Besides, the compiler of such an edition would often find
himself in doubt as to what the best text really was, the merit of the
different readings being sometimes almost equal, or very nearly
balanced; and, were he to endeavour to get out of the difficulty by
obtaining the judgments of literary men, or even of contemporary poets,
he would find that their opinions would in most cases be dissimilar, if
they did not openly conflict. Those who cannot come to a final decision
as to their own text would not be likely to agree as to the merits of
particular readings in the poems of their predecessors. Unanimity of
opinion on this point is indeed quite unattainable.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, it would be easy for an editor to show the unfortunate
result of keeping rigorously either to the latest or to the earliest
text of Wordsworth. If, on the one hand, the latest were taken, it could
be shown that many of the changes introduced into it were for the worse,
and some of them very decidedly so. For example, in the poem <i>To a
Skylark</i>&mdash;composed in 1825&mdash;the second verse, retained in the
editions of 1827, 1832, 1836, and 1843, was unaccountably dropped out in
the editions of 1845 and 1849. The following is the complete poem of
1825, as published in 1827.

<blockquote>Ethereal Minstrel! Pilgrim of the sky!<br>
Dost thou despise the earth where cares abound?<br>
Or, while the wings aspire, are heart and eye<br>
Both with thy nest upon the dewy ground?<br>
Thy nest which thou canst drop into at will,<br>
Those quivering wings composed, that music still!<br><br>

To the last point of vision, and beyond,<br>
Mount, daring Warbler! that love-prompted strain,<br>
('Twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond)<br>
Thrills not the less the bosom of the plain:<br>
Yet might'st thou seem, proud privilege! to sing<br>
All independent of the leafy spring.<br><br>

Leave to the Nightingale her shady wood;<br>
A privacy of glorious light is thine;<br>
Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood<br>
Of harmony, with rapture more divine;<br>
Type of the wise who soar, but never roam;<br>
True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home!</blockquote>

There is no doubt that the first and third stanzas are the finest, and
some may respect the judgment that cut down the Poem by the removal of
its second verse: but others will say, if it was right that such a verse
should be removed, why were many others of questionable merit allowed to
remain? Why was such a poem as <i>The Glowworm</i>, of the edition of
1807, never republished; while <i>The Waterfall and the Eglantine</i>,
and <i>To the Spade of a Friend</i>, were retained? To give one other
illustration, where a score are possible. In the sonnet, belonging to
the year 1807, beginning:

<blockquote>"Beloved Vale!" I said, "when I shall con,"</blockquote>

we find, in the latest text, the lines&mdash;first adopted in 1827:

<blockquote>I stood, of simple shame the blushing Thrall;<br>
So narrow seemed the brooks, the fields so small,</blockquote>

while the early edition of 1807 contains the far happier lines:

<blockquote>To see the Trees, which I had thought so tall,<br>
Mere dwarfs; the Brooks so narrow, Fields so small.</blockquote>

On the other hand, if the earliest text be invariably retained, some of
the best poems will be spoiled (or the improvements lost), since
Wordsworth did usually alter for the better. For example, few persons
will doubt that the form in which the second stanza of the poem <i>To
the Cuckoo</i> (written in 1802) appeared in 1845, is an improvement on
all its predecessors. I give the readings of 1807, 1815, 1820, 1827, and
1845.

Similarly, in each of the three poems <i>To the Daisy</i>, composed in
1802, and in the <i>Afterthought, to the Duddon</i>, the alterations
introduced into the latest editions were all improvements upon the early
version.<br>
<br>
It might be urged that these considerations would warrant the
interference of an editor, and justify him in selecting the text which
he thought the best upon the whole; but this must be left to posterity.
When editors can escape the bias of contemporary thought and feeling,
when their judgments are refined by distance and mellowed by the new
literary standards of the intervening years,&mdash;when in fact Wordsworth is
as far away from his critics as Shakespeare now is&mdash;it may be possible
to adjust a final text. But the task is beyond the power of the present
generation.<br>
<br>
It may farther be urged that if this reasoning be valid,&mdash;and if, for
the present, one text must be retained uniformly throughout,&mdash;the
natural plan is to take the earliest, and not the latest; and this has
some recommendations. It seems more simple, more natural, and certainly
the easiest. We have a natural sequence, if we begin with the earliest
and go on to the latest readings. Then, all the readers of Wordsworth,
who care to possess or to consult the present edition, will doubtless
possess one or other of the complete copies of his works, which contain
his final text; while probably not one in twenty have ever seen the
first edition of any of his poems, with the exception of <i>The
Prelude</i>. It is true that if the reader turns to a footnote to
compare the versions of different years, while he is reading for the
sake of the poetry, he will be so distracted that the effect of the poem
as a whole will be entirely lost; because the critical spirit, which
judges of the text, works apart from the spirit of sympathetic
appreciation, in which all poetry should be read. But it is not
necessary to turn to the footnotes, and to mark what may be called the
literary growth of a poem, while it is being read for its own sake: and
these notes are printed in smaller type, so as not to obtrude themselves
on the eye of the reader.<br>
<br>
Against the adoption of the earlier text, there is this fatal objection,
that if it is to be done at all, it must be done throughout; and, in the
earliest poems Wordsworth wrote&mdash;viz. <i>An Evening Walk</i> and
<i>Descriptive Sketches</i>,&mdash;the subsequent alterations almost amounted
to a cancelling of the earlier version. His changes were all, or almost
all, unmistakably for the better. Indeed, there was little in these
works&mdash;in the form in which they first appeared&mdash;to lead to the belief
that an original poet had arisen in England. It is true that Coleridge
saw in them the signs of the dawn of a new era, and wrote thus of
<i>Descriptive Sketches</i>, before he knew its author, "Seldom, if
ever, was the emergence of a great and original poetic genius above the
literary horizon more evidently announced." <a name="fr10">Nevertheless</a> the earliest
text of these <i>Sketches</i> is, in many places, so artificial,
prosaic, and dull, that its reproduction (except as an appendix, or in
the form of footnotes) would be an injustice to Wordsworth.<a href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> On the
other hand, the passages subsequently cancelled are so numerous, and so
long, that if placed in footnotes the latter would in some instances be
more extensive than the text. The quarto of 1793 will therefore be
reprinted in full as an Appendix to the first volume of this edition.
The <i>School Exercise written at Hawkshead</i> in the poet's fourteenth
year, will be found in vol. viii. Passing over these juvenile efforts,
there are poems&mdash;such as <i>Guilt and Sorrow</i>, <i>Peter Bell</i>, and
many others&mdash;in which the earlier text is an inferior one, which was
either corrected or abandoned by Wordsworth in his maturer years. It
would be a conspicuous blunder to print&mdash; in the place of honour,&mdash;the
crude original which was afterwards repudiated by its author.<br>
<br>
It <a name="fr11">may</a> be remembered, in connection with Wordsworth's text, that he
himself said, "I am for the most part uncertain about my success in
altering poems; but, in this case" (he is speaking of an insertion) "I
am sure I have produced a great improvement." (<i>Memoirs of
Wordsworth</i>, vol. i. p. 174.)<a href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Again, in writing to Mr. Dyce in
1830, "You know what importance I attach to following strictly the last
copy of the text of an author."<br>
<br>
It is also worthy of note that the study of their chronology casts some
light on the changes which the poems underwent. The second edition of
"Lyrical Ballads" appeared in 1800. In that edition the text of 1798 is
scarcely altered: but, in the year in which it was published, Wordsworth
was engrossed with his settlement at Grasmere; and, in the springtime of
creative work, he probably never thought of revising his earlier pieces.
In the year 1800, he composed at least twenty-five new poems. The third
edition of "Lyrical Ballads" appeared in 1802; and during that year he
wrote forty-three new poems, many of them amongst the most perfect of
his Lyrics. His critical instinct had become much more delicate since
1800: and it is not surprising to find&mdash;as we do find&mdash;that between the
text of the "Lyrical Ballads" of 1800, and that of 1802, there are many
important variations. This is seen, for example, in the way in which he
dealt with <i>The Female Vagrant</i>, which is altered throughout. Its
early redundance is pruned away; and, in many instances, the final text,
sanctioned in 1845, had been adopted in 1803. Without going into further
detail, it is sufficient to remark that in the year 1803 Wordsworth's
critical faculty, the faculty of censorship, had developed almost step
for step with the creative originality of his genius. In that prolific
year, when week by week, almost day by day, fresh poems were thrown off
with marvellous facility&mdash;as we see from his sister's Journal&mdash;he had
become a severe, if not a fastidious, critic of his own earlier work. A
further explanation of the absence of critical revision, in the edition
of 1800, may be found in the fact that during that year Wordsworth was
engaged in writing the "Preface" to his Poems; which dealt, in so
remarkable a manner, with the nature of Poetry in general, and with his
own theory of it in particular.<br>
<br>
A further reference to the <i>Evening Walk</i> will illustrate
Wordsworth's way of dealing with his earlier text in his later editions.
This Poem showed from the first a minute observation of Nature&mdash;not only
in her external form and colour, but also in her suggestiveness&mdash;though
not in her symbolism; and we also find the same transition from Nature
to Man, the same interest in rural life, and the same lingering over its
incidents that we see in his maturer poems. Nevertheless, there is much
that is conventional in the first edition of <i>An Evening Walk</i>,
published in 1793. I need only mention, as a sample, the use of the
phrase "silent tides" to describe the waters of a lake. When this poem
was revised, in the year 1815&mdash;with a view to its insertion in the first
edition of the collected works&mdash;Wordsworth merely omitted large portions
of it, and some of its best passages were struck out. He scarcely
amended the text at all. In 1820, however, he pruned and improved it
throughout; so that between this poem, as recast in 1820 (and reproduced
almost <i>verbatim</i> in the next two editions of 1827 and 1832), and
his happiest descriptions of Nature in his most inspired moods, there is
no great difference. But, in 1836, he altered it still further in
detail; and in that state practically left it, apparently not caring to
revise it further. In the edition of 1845, however, there are several
changes. So far as I can judge, there is one alteration for the worse,
and one only. The reading, in the edition of 1793,

<blockquote>In these lone vales, if aught of faith may claim,<br>
Thin silver hairs, and ancient hamlet fame;<br>
When up the hills, as now, retreats the light,<br>
Strange apparitions mock the village sight,</blockquote>

is better than that finally adopted,

<blockquote>In these secluded vales, if village fame,<br>
Confirmed by hoary hairs, belief may claim;<br>
When up the hills, as now, retired the light,<br>
Strange apparitions mocked the shepherd's sight.</blockquote>

It will be seen, however, from the changes made in the text of this
poem, how Wordsworth's observation of Nature developed, how thoroughly
dissatisfied he soon became with everything conventional, and discarded
every image not drawn directly or at first hand from Nature.<br>
<br>
The text adopted in the present edition is, for the reasons stated, that
which was finally sanctioned by Wordsworth himself, in the last edition
of his Poems (1849-50). The earlier readings, occurring in previous
editions, are given in footnotes; and it may be desirable to explain the
way in which these are arranged. It will be seen that whenever the text
has been changed a date is given in the footnote, <i>before</i> the
other readings are added. This date, which accompanies the reference
number of the footnote, indicates the year in which the reading finally
retained was first adopted by Wordsworth. <a name="fr12">The</a> earlier readings then
follow, in chronological order, with the year to which they belong;<a href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a>
and it is in every case to be assumed that the last of the changes
indicated was continued in all subsequent editions of the works. No
direct information is given as to how long a particular reading was
retained, or through how many editions it ran. It is to be assumed,
however, that it was retained in all intermediate editions till the next
change of text is stated. It would encumber the notes with too many
figures if, in every instance in which a change was made, the
corresponding state of the text in all the other editions was indicated.
But if no new reading follows the text quoted, it is to be taken for
granted that the reading in question was continued in every subsequent
edition, until the date which accompanies the reference figure.<br>
<br>
Two illustrations will make this clear. The first is a case in which the
text was only altered once, the second an instance in which it was
altered six times. In the <i>Evening Walk</i> the following lines
occur

<blockquote>The dog, loud barking, 'mid the glittering rocks, <br>
Hunts, where his master points, the intercepted flocks.</blockquote>

And the footnote is as follows:

	<td>1836<br>
	<br>

</table>

In the light of what has been said above, and by reference to the
Bibliography, it will be seen from these two dates that the original
text of 1793&mdash;given in the footnote&mdash;was continued in the editions of
1820, 1827, and 1832 (it was omitted from the "extract" of 1815); that
it was changed in the year 1836; and that this reading was retained in
the editions of 1843, 1845, and 1849.<br>
<br>
Again, in <i>Simon Lee</i>, the lines occur:

<blockquote>But what to them avails the land<br>
Which he can till no longer?</blockquote>

From this it will be seen that the text adopted in the first edition of
"Lyrical Ballads" in 1798 was retained in the editions of 1800, 1802,
1805, 1815, and 1820; that it was altered in each of the editions of
1827, 1832, 1837, 1840, as also in the MS. readings in Lord Coleridge's
copy of the works, and in the edition of 1845;  and that the version of
1845 was retained in the edition of 1849-50. It should be added that
when a verse, or stanza, or line&mdash;occurring in one or other of the
earlier editions&mdash;was omitted from that of 1849, the footnote simply
contains the extract along with the date of the year or years in which
it occurs; and that, in such cases, the date does not follow the
reference number of the footnote, but is placed for obvious reasons at
the end of the extract.<br>
<br>
The same thing is true of <i>Descriptive Sketches</i>. In the year 1827,
there were scarcely any alterations made on the text of the poem, as
printed in 1820; still fewer were added in 1832; but for the edition of
1836 the whole was virtually rewritten, and in that state it was finally
left, although a few significant changes were made in 1845.<br>
<br>
Slight changes of spelling which occur in the successive editions, are
not mentioned. When, however, the change is one of transposition,
although the text remains unaltered,&mdash;as is largely the case in <i>Simon
Lee</i>, for example&mdash;it is always indicated.<br>
<br>
It will be further observed that, at the beginning of every poem, two
dates are given; the first, on the left-hand side, is the date of
composition; the second, on the right-hand side, is the date of the
first publication. In what class the poem first appeared, and the
changes (if any) which subsequently occurred in its title, are mentioned
in the note appended.

	<td>In the present edition <b>several suggested changes of text</b>, which
were written by Wordsworth on the margin of a copy of his edition of
1836-7, which he kept beside him at Rydal Mount, are published. These
MS. notes seem to have been written by himself, or dictated to others,
at intervals between the years 1836 and 1850, and they are thus a record
of passing thoughts, or "moods of his own mind," during these years.
Some of these were afterwards introduced into the editions of 1842,
1846, and 1849; others were not made use of. The latter have now a value
of their own, as indicating certain new phases of thought and feeling,
in Wordsworth's later years. I owe my knowledge of them, and the
permission to use them, to the kindness of the late Chief Justice of
England, Lord Coleridge. The following is an extract from a letter from
him:

<blockquote>  "<b>Fox Ghyll</b>, <b>Ambleside</b>, <i>4th October 1881</i>.<br>
<br>
  "I have been long intending to write you as to the manuscript notes
  and alterations in Wordsworth's poems, which you have had the
  opportunity of seeing, and, so far as you thought fit, of using for
  your edition. They came into my possession in this way. I saw them
  advertised in a catalogue which was sent me, and at my request the
  book was very courteously forwarded to me for my inspection. It
  appeared to me of sufficient interest and value to induce me to buy
  it; and I accordingly became the purchaser.<br>
<br>
  "It is a copy of the edition in six volumes, the publication of which
  began in the year 1836; and of the volume containing the collected
  sonnets, which was afterwards printed uniformly with that edition. It
  appears to have been the copy which Wordsworth himself used for
  correcting, altering, and adding to the poems contained in it. As you
  have seen, in some of the poems the Alterations are very large,
  amounting sometimes to a complete rewriting of considerable passages.
  Many of these alterations have been printed in subsequent editions;
  some have not; two or three small poems, as far as I know, have not
  been hitherto published. Much of the writing is Wordsworth's own; but
  perhaps the larger portion is the hand-writing of others, one or more,
  not familiar to me as Wordsworth's is.<br>
<br>
  "How the volumes came to be sold I do not know.... Such as they are,
  and whatever be their interest or value, you are, as far as I am
  concerned, heartily welcome to them; and I shall be glad indeed if
  they add in the least degree to make your edition more worthy of the
  great man for whom my admiration grows every day I live, and my deep
  gratitude to whom will cease only with my life, and my reason."</blockquote>

This precious copy of the edition of 1836-7 is now the property of Lady
Coleridge. I re-examined it in 1894, and added several readings, which I
had omitted to note twelve years ago, when Lord Coleridge first showed
it to me. I should add that, since the issue of the volumes of 1882-6,
many other MS. copies of individual Poems have come under my notice; and
that every important variation of text in them is incorporated in this
edition.<br>
<br>
As it is impossible to discover the precise year in which the suggested
alterations of text were written by Wordsworth, on the margin of the
edition of 1836, they will be indicated, wherever they occur, by the
initial letter C. Comparatively few changes occur in the poems of early
years.<br>

A copy of the 1814 (quarto) edition of <i>The Excursion</i>, now in the
possession of a grandson of the poet, the Rev. John Wordsworth, Gosforth
Rectory, Cumberland&mdash;which was the copy Wordsworth kept at Rydal Mount
for annotation and correction, much in the same way as he kept the
edition of 1836-7&mdash;has also been kindly sent to me by its present owner,

additional readings.</td>

the Poet's life; and it is to their friendship, and to her inducing
Wordsworth to dictate these Notes, that we owe most of the information
we possess, as to the occasions and circumstances under which his poems
were composed. These notes were first made use of&mdash;although only in a
fragmentary manner&mdash;by the late Bishop of Lincoln, in the <i>Memoirs</i>
of his uncle. They were afterwards incorporated in full in the edition
of 1857, issued by Mr. Moxon, under the direction of Mr. Carter; and in
the centenary edition. They were subsequently printed in <i>The Prose
Works of Wordsworth</i>, edited by Dr. Grosart; and in my edition of
1882-6. I am uncertain whether it was the original MS., written by Miss
Fenwick, or the copy of it afterwards taken for Miss Quillinan, to which
Dr. Grosart had access. The text of these Notes, as printed in the
edition of 1857, is certainly (in very many cases) widely different from
what is given in <i>The Prose Works</i> of 1876. I have made many
corrections&mdash;from the MS. which I have examined with care&mdash;of errors
which exist in all previously printed copies of these Notes, including
my own.<br>
<br>
What appears in this volume is printed from a MS., which Miss Quillinan
gave me to examine and copy, and which she assured me was the original
one. The proper place for these Fenwick Notes is doubtless that which
was assigned to them by the editor of 1857, viz. before the poems which
they respectively illustrate.</td>

	<td><b>Topographical Notes</b>, explanatory of the allusions made by
Wordsworth to the localities in the English Lake District, and
elsewhere, are added throughout the volumes. This has already been
attempted to some extent by several writers, but a good deal more
remains to be done; and I may repeat what I wrote on this subject, in
1878.<br>
<br>
Many of Wordsworth's allusions to Place are obscure, and the exact
localities difficult to identify. It is doubtful if he cared whether
they could be afterwards traced out or not; and in reference to one
particular rock, referred to in the "Poems on the Naming of Places,"
when asked by a friend to localise it, he declined; replying to the
question, "Yes, that&mdash;or any other that will suit!" There is no doubt
that, in many instances, his allusions to place are intentionally vague;
and, in some of his most realistic passages, he avowedly weaves together
a description of localities remote from each other.<br>
<br>
It is true that "Poems of Places" are not meant to be photographs; and
were they simply to reproduce the features of a particular district, and
be an exact transcript of reality, they would be literary photographs,
and not poems. Poetry cannot, in the nature of things, be a mere
register of phenomena appealing to the eye or the ear. No imaginative
writer, however, in the whole range of English Literature, is so
peculiarly identified with locality as Wordsworth is; and there is not
one on the roll of poets, the appreciation of whose writings is more
aided by an intimate knowledge of the district in which he lived. The
wish to be able to identify his allusions to those places, which he so
specially interpreted, is natural to every one who has ever felt the
spell of his genius; and it is indispensable to all who would know the
special charm of a region, which he described as "a national property,"
and of which he, beyond all other men, may be said to have effected the
literary "conveyance" to posterity.<br>
<br>
But it has been asked&mdash;and will doubtless be asked again&mdash;what is the
use of a minute identification of all these places? Is not the general
fact that Wordsworth described this district of mountain, vale, and
mere, sufficient, without any further attempt at localisation? The
question is more important, and has wider bearings, than appears upon
the surface.<br>
<br>
It must be admitted, on the one hand, that the discovery of the precise
point in every local allusion is not necessary to an understanding or
appreciation of the Poems. But, it must be remembered, on the other
hand, that Wordsworth was never contented with simply copying what he
saw in Nature. <a name="fr13">Of</a> the <i>Evening Walk</i>&mdash;written in his eighteenth
year&mdash;he says that the plan of the poem

<blockquote>"has not been confined to a particular walk or an individual place; a
  proof (of which I was unconscious at the time) of my unwillingness to
  submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and real circumstance.
  The country is idealised rather than described in any one of its local
  aspects."<a href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> </blockquote>

<a name="fr14">Again</a>, he says of the <i>Lines written while Sailing in a Boat at
Evening</i>:

<blockquote>"It was during a solitary walk on the banks of the Cam that I was
  first struck with this appearance, and applied it to my own feelings
  in the manner here expressed, changing the scene to the Thames, near
  Windsor";<a href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></blockquote>

<a name="fr15">and</a> of <i>Guilt and Sorrow</i>, he said,

<blockquote>"To obviate some distraction in the minds of those who are well
  acquainted with Salisbury Plain, it may be proper to say, that of the
  features described as belonging to it, one or two are taken from other
  desolate parts of England."<a href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> </blockquote>

In <i>The Excursion</i> he passes from Langdale to Grasmere, over to
Patterdale, back to Grasmere, and again to Hawes Water, without warning;
and even in the case of the "Duddon Sonnets" he introduces a description
taken direct from Rydal. Mr. Aubrey de Vere tells of a conversation he
had with Wordsworth, in which he vehemently condemned the
ultra-realistic poet, who goes to Nature with

<blockquote>"pencil and note-book, and jots down whatever strikes him most,"
  adding, "Nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms!
  He should have left his pencil and note-book at home; fixed his eye as
  he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him, and
  taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy. Afterwards he
  would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was
  preserved to him, much was also most wisely obliterated. <i>That which
  remained, the picture surviving in his mind, would have presented the
  ideal and essential truth of the scene, and done so in large part by
  discarding much which, though in itself striking, was not
  characteristic.</i> In every scene, many of the most brilliant details
  are but accidental." </blockquote>

The two last sentences of this extract give admirable expression to one
feature of Wordsworth's interpretation of Nature. In the deepest poetry,
as in the loftiest music,&mdash;in Wordsworth's lyrics as in Beethoven's
sonatas&mdash;it is by what they unerringly suggest and not by what they
exhaustively express that their truth and power are known. "In what he
leaves unsaid," wrote Schiller, "I discover the master of style." It
depends, no doubt, upon the vision of the "inward eye," and the
reproductive power of the idealising mind, whether the result is a
travesty of Nature, or the embodiment of a truth higher than Nature
yields. On the other hand, it is equally certain that the identification
of localities casts a sudden light in many instances upon obscure
passages in a poem, and is by far the best commentary that can be given.
It is much to be able to compare the actual scene, with the ideal
creation suggested by it; as the latter was both Wordsworth's reading of
the text of Nature, and his interpretation of it. In his seventy-third
year, he said, looking back on his <i>Evening Walk</i>, that there was
not an image in the poem which he had not observed, and that he
"recollected the time and place where most of them were noted." In the
Fenwick notes, we constantly find him saying, "the fact occurred
strictly as recorded," "the fact was as mentioned in the poem"; and the
fact very often involved the accessories of place.<br>
<br>
Any one who has tried to trace out the allusions in the "Poems on the
Naming of Places," or to discover the site of "Michael's Sheepfold," to
identify "Ghimmer Crag," or "Thurston-Mere,"&mdash;not to speak of the
individual "rocks" and "recesses" near Blea Tarn at the head of Little
Langdale so minutely described in <i>The Excursion</i>,&mdash;will admit that
local commentary is an important aid to the understanding of Wordsworth.
If to read the <i>Yew Trees</i> in Borrowdale itself,

<blockquote>in mute repose<br>
To lie, and listen to the mountain flood<br>
Murmuring from Glaramara's inmost caves,</blockquote>

to read <i>The Brothers</i> in Ennerdale, or "The Daffodils" by the
shore of Ullswater, gives a new significance to these "poems of the
imagination," a discovery of the obscurer allusions to place or scene
will deepen our appreciation of those passages in which his idealism is
most pronounced. Every one knows Kirkstone Pass, Aira Force, Dungeon
Ghyll, the Wishing Gate, and Helm Crag: many persons know the Glowworm
Rock, and used to know the Rock of Names; but where is "Emma's Dell"? or
"the meeting point of two highways," so characteristically described in
the twelfth book of <i>The Prelude</i>? and who will fix the site of the
pool in Rydal Upper Park, immortalised in the poem <i>To M. H.</i>? or
identify "Joanna's Rock"? Many of the places in the English Lake
District are undergoing change, and every year the local allusions will
be more difficult to trace. Perhaps the most interesting memorial of the
poet which existed, viz. the "Rock of Names," on the shore of Thirlmere,
is now sunk under the waters of a Manchester reservoir. Other memorials
are perishing by the wear and tear of time, the decay of old buildings,
the alteration of roads, the cutting down of trees, and the modernising,
or "improving," of the district generally. All this is inevitable. But
it is well that many of the natural objects, over and around which the
light of Wordsworth's genius lingers, are out of the reach of
"improvements," and are indestructible even by machinery.<br>
<br>
If it be objected that several of the places which we try to
identify&mdash;and which some would prefer to leave for ever undisturbed in
the realm of imagination &mdash;were purposely left obscure, it may be
replied that Death and Time have probably now removed all reasons for
reticence, especially in the case of those poems referring to domestic
life and friendly ties. While an author is alive, or while those are
alive to whom he has made reference in the course of his allusions to
place, it may even be right that works designed for posterity should not
be dealt with after the fashion of the modern "interviewer." But
greatness has its penalties; and a "fierce light" "beats around the
throne" of Genius, as well as round that of Empire. Moreover, all
experience shows that posterity takes a great and a growing interest in
exact topographical illustrations of the works of great authors. The
labour recently bestowed upon the places connected with Shakespeare,
Scott, and Burns sufficiently attests this.<br>
<br>
The localities in Westmoreland, which are most permanently associated
with Wordsworth, are these: Grasmere, where he lived during the years of
his "poetic prime," and where he is buried; Lower Easdale, where he
passed so many days with his sister by the side of the brook, and on the
terraces at Lancrigg, and where <i>The Prelude</i> was dictated; Rydal
Mount, where he spent the latter half of his life, and where he found
one of the most perfect retreats in England; Great Langdale, and Blea
Tarn at the head of Little Langdale, immortalised in <i>The
Excursion</i>; the upper end of Ullswater, and Kirkstone Pass; and all
the mountain tracks and paths round Grasmere and Rydal, especially the
old upper road between them, under Nab Scar, his favourite walk during
his later years, where he "composed hundreds of verses." There is
scarcely a rock or mountain summit, a stream or tarn, or even a well, a
grove, or forest-side in all that neighbourhood, which is not
imperishably identified with this poet, who at once interpreted them as
they had never been interpreted before, and added

<blockquote>                the gleam,<br>
The light that never was, on sea or land,<br>
The consecration, and the Poet's dream.</blockquote>

It may be worthy of note that Wordsworth himself sanctioned the
principle of tracing out local allusions both by dictating the Fenwick
notes, and by republishing his Essay on the topography of the Lakes,
along with the Duddon Sonnets, in 1820&mdash;and also, by itself, in
1822&mdash;"from a belief that it would tend materially to illustrate" his
poems.<br>
<br>
In this edition the topographical Notes usually follow the Poems to
which they refer. But in the case of the longer Poems, such as <i>The
Prelude</i>, <i>The Excursion</i>, and others, it seems more convenient
to print them at the foot of the page, than to oblige the reader to turn
to the end of the volume.<br>
<br>
From the accident of my having tried long ago&mdash; at Principal Shairp's
request&mdash;to do what he told me he wished to do, but had failed to carry
out, I have been supposed, quite erroneously, to be an <i>authority</i>
on the subject of "The English Lake District, as interpreted in the
Poems of Wordsworth." The latter, it is true, is the title of one of the
books which I have written about Wordsworth: but, although I visited the
Lakes in 1860,&mdash;"as a pilgrim resolute"&mdash;and have re-visited the
district nearly every year for more than a quarter of a century, I may
say that I have only a partial knowledge of it. Others, such as Canon
Rawnsley, Mr. Harry Goodwin, and Mr. Rix, for example, know many parts
of it much better than I do; but, as I have often had to compare my own
judgment with that of such experts as the late Dr. Cradock, Principal of
Brasenose College, Oxford, and others, I may add that, when I differ
from them, it has been only after a re-examination of their evidence, at
the localities themselves.</td>

	<td><b>6.</b></td>
	<td>Several<b> Poems, and fragments of poems, hitherto unpublished</b>&mdash;or
published in stray quarters, and in desultory fashion&mdash;will find a place
in this edition; but I reserve these fragments, and place them all
together, in an Appendix to the last volume of the "Poetical Works." If
it is desirable to print these poems, in such an edition as this, it is
equally desirable to separate them from those which Wordsworth himself
sanctioned in his final edition of 1849-50.<br>
<br>
Every great author in the Literature of the World&mdash;whether he lives to
old age (when his judgment may possibly be less critical) or dies young
(when it may be relatively more accurate)&mdash;should himself determine what
portions of his work ought, and what ought not to survive. At the same
time,&mdash;while I do not presume to judge in the case of writers whom I
know less fully than I happen to know Wordsworth and his
contemporaries,&mdash;it seems clear that the very greatest men have
occasionally erred as to what parts of their writings might, with most
advantage, survive; and that they have even more frequently erred as to
what MS. letters, etc.,&mdash;casting light on their contemporaries&mdash;should,
or should not, be preserved. I am convinced, for example, that if the
Wordsworth household had not destroyed all the letters which Coleridge
sent to them, in the first decade of this century, the world would now
possess much important knowledge which is for ever lost. It may have
been wise, for reasons now unknown, to burn those letters, written by
Coleridge: but the students of the literature of the period would gladly
have them now.<br>
<br>
Passing from the question of the preservation of Letters, it is evident
that Wordsworth was very careful in distinguishing between the Verses
which he sent to Newspapers and Magazines, and those Poems which he
included in his published volumes. His anxiety on this point may be
inferred from the way in which he more than once emphasised the fact of
republication, e.g. in <i>Peter Bell</i> (1819) he put the following
prefatory note to four sonnets, which had previously appeared in
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, and which afterwards (1828) appeared in the
<i>Poetical Album</i> of Alaric Watts, "The following Sonnets having
lately appeared in Periodical Publications are here reprinted."<br>
<br>
Some of the poems (or fragments of poems), included in the
<i>addenda</i> to Volume viii. of this edition, I would willingly have
left out (especially the sonnet addressed to Miss Maria Williams); but,
since they have appeared elsewhere, I feel justified in now reprinting
even that trivial youthful effusion, signed "Axiologus." I rejoice,
however, that there is no likelihood that the "Somersetshire Tragedy"
will ever see the light. When I told Wordsworth's successor in the
Laureateship that I had burned a copy of that poem, sent to me by one to
whom it had been confided, his delight was great. It is the chronicle of
a revolting crime, with nothing in the verse to warrant its publication.
The only curious thing about it is that Wordsworth wrote it. With this
exception, there is no reason why the fragments which he did not himself
republish, and others which he published but afterwards suppressed,
should not now be printed. The suppression of some of these by the poet
himself is as unaccountable, as is his omission of certain stanzas in
the earlier poems from their later versions. <a name="fr16">Even</a> the Cambridge
<i>Installation Ode</i>, which is so feeble, will be reprinted.<a href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a>
<i>The Glowworm</i>, which only appeared in the edition of 1807, will be
republished in full. <i>Andrew Jones</i>,&mdash;also suppressed after
appearing in "Lyrical Ballads" of 1800, 1802, and 1805,&mdash;will be
replaced, in like manner. The youthful <i>School Exercise</i> written at
Hawkshead, the translation from the <i>Georgics</i> of Virgil, the poem
addressed <i>To the Queen</i> in 1846, will appear in their
chronological place in vol. viii. There are also a translation of some
French stanzas by Francis Wrangham on <i>The Birth of Love</i>-a poem
entitled <i>The Eagle and the Dove</i>, which was privately printed in a
volume, consisting chiefly of French fragments, and called <i>La petite
Chouannerie, ou Historie d'un College Breton sous l'Empire</i>&mdash;a sonnet
on the rebuilding of a church at Cardiff&mdash;an Election Squib written
during the Lowther and Brougham contest for the representation of the
county of Cumberland in 1818&mdash;some stanzas written in the Visitors' Book
at the Ferry, Windermere, and other fragments. Then, since Wordsworth
published some verses by his sister Dorothy in his own volumes, other
unpublished fragments by Miss Wordsworth may find a place in this
edition. I do not attach much importance, however, to the recovery of
these unpublished poems. The <a name="fr17">truth</a> is, as Sir Henry Taylor&mdash;himself a
poet and critic of no mean order&mdash;remarked,<a href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a>

<blockquote> "In these days, when a
great man's path to posterity is likely to be more and more crowded,
there is a tendency to create an obstruction, in the desire to give an
impulse. To gather about a man's work all the details that can be found
out about it is, in my opinion, to put a drag upon it; and, as of the
Works, so of the Life." </blockquote>

The industrious labour of some editors in
disinterring the trivial works of great men is not a commendable
industry. All great writers have occasionally written trifles&mdash;this is
true even of Shakespeare&mdash;and if they wished them to perish, why should
we seek to resuscitate them? Besides, this labour&mdash;whether due to the
industry of admiring friends, or to the ambition of the literary
resurrectionist&mdash;is futile; because the verdict of Time is sure, and
posterity is certain to consign the recovered trivialities to kindly
oblivion. The question which should invariably present itself to the
editor of the fragments of a great writer is, "<i>Can these bones
live</i>?" If they cannot, they had better never see the light. Indeed
the only good reason for reprinting the fragments which have been lost
(because the author himself attached no value to them), is that, in a
complete collection of the works of a great man, some of them may have a
biographic or psychological value. But have we any right to reproduce,
from an antiquarian motive, what&mdash;in a literary sense&mdash;is either
trivial, or feeble, or sterile?<br>
<br>
We must, however, distinguish between what is suitable for an edition
meant either to popularise an author, or to interpret him, and an
edition intended to bring together all that is worthy of preservation
for posterity. There is <a name="fr18">great</a> truth in what Mr. Arnold has lately said
of Byron:

<blockquote>"I question whether by reading everything which he gives us,
we are so likely to acquire an admiring sense, even of his variety and
abundance, as by reading what he gives us at his happier moments.
Receive him absolutely without omission and compromise, follow his whole
outpouring, stanza by stanza, and line by line, from the very
commencement to the very end, and he is capable of being tiresome."<a href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></blockquote>

This is quite true; nevertheless, English literature demands a complete
edition of all the works of Byron: and it may be safely predicted that,
for weightier reasons and with greater urgency, it will continue to call
for the collected works of Wordsworth.<br>
<br>
It should also be noted that the fact of Wordsworth's having dictated to
Miss Fenwick (so late as 1843) a stanza from <i>The Convict</i> in his
note to <i>The Lament of Mary Queen of Scots</i> (1817), justifies the
inclusion of the whole of that (suppressed) poem in such an edition as
this.<br>
<br>
The fact that Wordsworth did not republish all his Poems, in his final
edition of 1849-50, is not conclusive evidence that he thought them
unworthy of preservation, and reproduction. It must be remembered that
<i>The Prelude</i> itself was a posthumous publication; and also that
the fragmentary canto of <i>The Recluse</i>, entitled "Home at
Grasmere"&mdash;as well as the other canto published in 1886, and entitled
(most prosaically) "Composed when a probability existed of our being
obliged to quit Rydal Mount as a residence"&mdash;were not published by the
poet himself. I am of opinion that his omission of the stanzas beginning:

<blockquote> Among all lovely things my Love had been,</blockquote>

and of the sonnet on his <i>Voyage down the Rhine</i>, was due to sheer
forgetfulness of their existence. Few poets remember all their past,
fugitive, productions. At the same time, there are other
fragments,&mdash;written when he was experimenting with his theme, and when
the inspiration of genius had forsaken him,&mdash;which it is unfortunate
that he did not himself destroy.<br>
<br>
Among the Poems which Wordsworth suppressed, in his final edition, is
the Latin translation of <i>The Somnambulist</i> by his son. This will
be republished, more especially as it was included by Wordsworth himself
in the second edition of his "Yarrow Revisited."<br>
<br>
It may be well to mention the <i>repetitions</i> which are inevitable in
this edition,

<ol type="1">
<li>As already explained, those fragments of <i>The
Recluse</i>&mdash;which were issued in all the earlier volumes, and
afterwards incorporated in <i>The Prelude</i>&mdash;are printed as they
originally appeared.</li>
<li>Short Notes are extracted from Dorothy
Wordsworth's <i>Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland</i> (1803),
which illustrate the Poems composed during that Tour, while the whole
text of that Tour will be printed in full in subsequent volumes.</li>
<li>Other fragments, including the lines beginning,</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>Wisdom and Spirit of the universe,</blockquote>

will be printed both by themselves in their chronological place, and in
the longer poem of which they form a part, according to the original
plan of their author.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<br>
A detail, perhaps not too trivial to mention, is that, in this
edition&mdash;at the suggestion of several friends &mdash;I have followed the
example of Professor Dowden in his Aldine edition, and numbered the
lines of almost all the poems&mdash;even the sonnets. <a name="fr19">When</a> I have not done
so, the reason will be obvious; viz. either the structure, or the
brevity, of the poem.<a href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a><br>
<br>
In giving the date of each poem, I have used the word "composed," rather
than "written," very much because Wordsworth himself,&mdash;and his sister,
in her Journals&mdash;almost invariably use the word "composed"; although he
criticised the term as applied to the creation of a poem, as if it were
a manufactured article. In <a name="fr20">his</a> Chronological Table, Mr. Dowden adopts
the word "composed"; but, in his edition of the Poems, he has made use
of the term" written."<a href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a><br>
<br>
No notice (or almost none) of misprints in Wordsworth's own text is
taken, in the notes to this edition. Sometimes an error occurred, and
was carried on through more than one edition, and corrected in the next:
e.g., in 'The Childless Father', the editions of 1827, 1832, and 1836
have the line:

<blockquote>Fresh springs of green boxwood, not six months before.</blockquote>

In the 'errata' of the edition of 1836 this is corrected to "fresh
sprigs." There are other 'errata', which remained in the edition of
1849-50, e.g., in 'Rob Roy's Grave', "Vools" for "Veols," and mistakes
in quotations from other poets, such as "invention" for "instruction,"
in Wither's poem on the Daisy. These are corrected without mention.<br>
<br>
I should perhaps add that, while I have included, amongst the
illustrative notes, extracts from Henry Crabb Robinson's 'Diary', etc.,
many of them are now published for the first time. These voluminous MSS.
of Robinson's have been re-examined with care; and the reader who
compares the three volumes of the 'Diary', etc.&mdash;edited by Dr.
Sadler&mdash;with the extracts now printed from the original MS., will see
where sentences omitted by the original editor have been included.<br>
<br>
As this edition proceeds, my debt to many&mdash;who have been so kind as to
put their Wordsworth MSS. and memoranda at my disposal&mdash;will be
apparent.<br>
<br>
It is difficult to acknowledge duly my obligation to collectors of
autograph Letters&mdash;Mr. Morrison, the late Mr. Locker Lampson, the late
Mr. Mackay, of the Grange, Trowbridge, and a score of others&mdash; but, I
may say in general, that the kindness of those who possess Wordsworth
MSS. in allowing me to examine them, has been a very genuine evidence of
their interest in the Poet, and his work.<br>
<br>
My special thanks are due to Mr. Gordon Wordsworth, who has, in the
kindest manner and for many years, placed everything at my disposal,
which could further my labour on his grandfather's Works.<br>
<br>
Finally, I wish to express the great debt I owe to the late Mr. J. Dykes
Campbell, for many suggestions, and for his unwearied interest in this
work,&mdash; which I think was second only to his interest in Coleridge&mdash;and
also to Mr. W. B. Kinghorn for his valuable assistance in the revision
of proof sheets.<br>
<br>
If there are any desiderata, in reference to Wordsworth &mdash;in addition to
a new Life, a critical Essay, and such a Bibliography of Criticism as
will be adequate for posterity&mdash;a 'Concordance' to his works is one of
them. A correspondent once offered to prepare this for me, if I found a
publisher: and another has undertaken to compile a volume of 'parallel
passages' from the earlier poets of England, and of the world. A
Concordance might very well form part of a volume of 'Wordsworthiana',
and be a real service to future students of the poet.<br>

<h2><a name="section1">Extract from the Conclusion of a Poem, composed in Anticipation of leaving School</a></h2>

<h4>Composed 1786.&mdash;Published 1815</h4>

<a href="#section1a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">This poem was placed by Wordsworth among his "Juvenile Pieces." The
following note was prefixed to that Series, from 1820 to 1832:</span>

<blockquote>  "Of the Poems in this class, "<b>The Evening Walk</b>" and "<b>Descriptive
  Sketches</b>" were first published in 1793. They are reprinted with some
  unimportant alterations that were chiefly made very soon after their
  publication. It would have been easy to amend them, in many passages,
  both as to sentiment and expression, and I have not been altogether
  able to resist the temptation: but attempts of this kind are made at
  the risk of injuring those characteristic features, which, after all,
  will be regarded as the principal recommendation of juvenile poems."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In 1836 "unimportant" was erased before "alterations"; and after
"temptation" the following was added, "as will be obvious to the
attentive reader, in some instances: these are few, for I am aware that
attempts of this kind," etc.</span>

<blockquote>  "The above, which was written some time ago, scarcely applies to the
  Poem, 'Descriptive Sketches', as it now stands. The corrections,
  though numerous, are not, however, such as to prevent its retaining
  with propriety a place in the class of 'Juvenile Pieces.'"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the editions of 1845 and 1849, Wordsworth called his "Juvenile
Pieces," "Poems written in Youth."&mdash;Ed.</span>

<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;"> "Dear native regions," etc., 1786, Hawkshead. The beautiful image
  with which this poem concludes suggested itself to me while I was
  resting in a boat along with my companions under the shade of a
  magnificent row of sycamores, which then extended their branches from
  the shore of the promontory upon which stands the ancient, and at that
  time the more picturesque, Hall of Coniston, the Seat of the Le
  Flemings from very early times. The Poem of which it was the
  conclusion, was of many hundred lines, and contained thoughts and
  images, most of which have been dispersed through my other
  writings.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the editions 1815 to 1832, the title given to this poem was 'Extract
from the conclusion of a Poem, composed upon leaving School'. The row of
sycamores at Hawkshead, referred to in the Fenwick note, no longer
exists.<br>
<br>
In <a name="frA">the</a> "Autobiographical Memoranda," dictated by Wordsworth at Rydal
Mount in November 1847, he says,</span> <blockquote>" .... I wrote, while yet a schoolboy,
a long poem running upon my own adventures, and the scenery of the
county in which I was brought up. The only part of that poem which has
been preserved is the conclusion of it, which stands at the beginning of
my collected Poems."<a href="#fA"><sup>A</sup></a></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the eighth book of 'The Prelude', (lines 468-475), this fragment is
introduced, and there Wordsworth tells us that once, when boating on
Coniston Lake (Thurston-mere) in his boyhood, he entered under a grove
of trees on its "western marge," and glided "along the line of
low-roofed water," "as in a cloister." He adds, </span>

<blockquote>while, in that shade<br>
Loitering, I watched the golden beams of light<br>
Flung from the setting sun, as they reposed<br>
In silent beauty on the naked ridge<br>
Of a high eastern hill&mdash;thus flowed my thoughts<br>
In a pure stream of words fresh from the heart:</blockquote>Ed.

<h2><a name="section3">An Evening Walk</a></h2>
<br>
<i>Addressed to a Young Lady</i><br>

<h4>Composed 1787-9<span style="font-size: 70%;"><sup>A</sup></span>&mdash;Published 1793</h4>
<a href="#section3a">The Poem</a><br>

<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">The young Lady to whom this was addressed was my Sister. It was
  composed at School, and during my first two College vacations. There
  is not an image in it which I have not observed; and, now in my
  seventy-third year, I recollect the time and place, when most of them
  were noticed. I will confine myself to one instance:</span>

<blockquote>Waving his hat, the shepherd, from the vale,<br>
Directs his winding dog the cliffs to scale,&mdash;<br>
The dog, loud barking, 'mid the glittering rocks,<br>
Hunts, where his master points, the intercepted flocks.</blockquote>

<span style="color: #663300;">  I was an eye-witness of this for the first time while crossing the
  Pass of Dunmail Raise. Upon second thought, I will mention another
  image:</span>

<blockquote>And, fronting the bright west, yon oak entwines<br>
    Its darkening boughs and leaves, in stronger lines.</blockquote>

<span style="color: #663300;">  This is feebly and imperfectly expressed, but I recollect distinctly
  the very spot where this first struck me. It was on the way between
  Hawkshead and Ambleside, and gave me extreme pleasure. The moment was
  important in my poetical history; for I date from it my consciousness
  of the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been
  unnoticed by the poets of any age or country, so far as I was
  acquainted with them; and I made a resolution to supply in some degree
  the deficiency. I could not have been at that time above fourteen
  years of age. The description of the swans, that follows, was taken
  from the daily opportunities I had of observing their habits, not as
  confined to the gentleman's park, but in a state of nature. There were
  two pairs of them that divided the lake of Esthwaite, and its
  in-and-out flowing streams, between them, never trespassing a single
  yard upon each other's separate domain. They were of the old
  magnificent species, bearing in beauty and majesty about the same
  relation to the Thames swan which that does to the goose. <a name="fr2b">It</a> was from
  the remembrance of those noble creatures, I took, thirty years after,
  the picture of the swan which I have discarded from the poem of
  'Dion'. While I was a schoolboy, the late Mr. Curwen introduced a
  little fleet of these birds, but of the inferior species, to the lake
  of Windermere. Their principal home was about his own island; but they
  sailed about into remote parts of the lake, and either from real or
  imagined injury done to the adjoining fields, they were got rid of at
  the request of the farmers and proprietors, but to the great regret of
  all who had become attached to them from noticing their beauty and
  quiet habits. I will conclude my notice of this poem by observing that
  the plan of it has not been confined to a particular walk, or an
  individual place; a proof (of which I was unconscious at the time) of
  my unwillingness to submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and
  real circumstance. The country is idealised rather than described in
  any one of its local aspects.&mdash;I. F.</span><br>
<a href="#26A">cross-reference: return to Footnote A of <i>The Idiot Boy</i></a></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The title of this poem, as first published in 1793, was <i>An Evening
Walk. An epistle; in verse. Addressed to a Young Lady, from the Lakes of
the North of England. By W. Wordsworth, B.A., of St. John's, Cambridge</i>.
Extracts from it were published in all the collected editions of the
poems under the general title of "Juvenile Pieces," from 1815 to 1843;
and, in 1845 and 1849, of "Poems written in Youth." The following
prefatory note to the "Juvenile Pieces" occurs in the editions 1820 to
1832. </span>

<blockquote>  "They are reprinted with some unimportant alterations that were
  chiefly made very soon after their publication. It would have been
  easy to amend them, in many passages, both as to sentiment and
  expression, and I have not been altogether able to resist the
  temptation: but attempts of this kind are made at the risk of injuring
  those characteristic features, which, after all, will be regarded as
  the principal recommendation of juvenile poems." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">To this, Wordsworth added, in 1836, </span>

<blockquote>  "The above, which was written some time ago, scarcely applies to the
  Poem, <i>Descriptive Sketches</i>, as it now stands. The corrections,
  though numerous, are not, however, such as to prevent its retaining
  with propriety a place in the class of 'Juvenile Pieces.'" </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In May 1794 Wordsworth wrote to his friend Mathews, </span>

<blockquote>  "It was with great reluctance that I sent these two little works into
  the world in so imperfect a state. But as I had done nothing at the
  University, I thought these little things might show that I <i>could</i> do
  something."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth's notes to this poem are printed from the edition of 1793.
Slight variations in the text of these notes in subsequent editions, in
the spelling of proper names, and in punctuation, are not noted.&mdash;Ed.</span>

	<td>Far from my dearest Friend, 'tis mine to rove<br>
Through bare grey dell, high wood, and pastoral cove;<br>
Where Derwent rests, and listens to the roar<br>
That stuns the tremulous cliffs of high Lodore;<br>
Where peace to Grasmere's lonely island leads,<br>
To willowy hedge-rows, and to emerald meads;<br>
Leads to her bridge, rude church, and cottaged grounds,<br>
Her rocky sheepwalks, and her woodland bounds;<br>
Where, undisturbed by winds, Winander sleeps<br>
'Mid clustering isles, and holly-sprinkled steeps;<br>
Where twilight glens endear my Esthwaite's shore,<br>

The spirit sought not then, in cherished sadness,<br>
A cloudy substitute for failing gladness.<br>
In youth's keen eye the livelong day was bright,<br>
The sun at morning, and the stars at night,<br>
Alike, when first the bittern's hollow bill<br>
Was heard, or woodcocks roamed the moonlight hill.<br><br>

In thoughtless gaiety I coursed the plain,<br>
And hope itself was all I knew of pain;<br>
For then, the inexperienced heart would beat<br>
At times, while young Content forsook her seat,<br>
And wild Impatience, pointing upward, showed, <br>
Through passes yet unreached, a brighter road.<br>
Alas! the idle tale of man is found<br>
Depicted in the dial's moral round;<br>
Hope with reflection blends her social rays<br>
To gild the total tablet of his days; <br>
Yet still, the sport of some malignant power,<br>
He knows but from its shade the present hour.<br>
<br>
  But why, ungrateful, dwell on idle pain?<br>
To show what pleasures yet to me remain,<br>
Say, will my Friend, with unreluctant ear,<br>
The history of a poet's evening hear?<br><br>

  When, in the south, the wan noon, brooding still,<br>
Breathed a pale steam around the glaring hill,<br>
And shades of deep-embattled clouds were seen,<br>
Spotting the northern cliffs with lights between; <br>
When crowding cattle, checked by rails that make<br>
A fence far stretched into the shallow lake,<br>
Lashed the cool water with their restless tails,<br>
Or from high points of rock looked out for fanning gales;<br>
When school-boys stretched their length upon the green;<br>
And round the broad-spread oak, a glimmering scene, <br>
In the rough fern-clad park, the herded deer<br>
Shook the still-twinkling tail and glancing ear;<br>
When horses in the sunburnt intake stood,<br>
And vainly eyed below the tempting flood, <br>
Or tracked the passenger, in mute distress,<br>
With forward neck the closing gate to press&mdash;<br>
Then, while I wandered where the huddling rill<br>
Brightens with water-breaks the hollow ghyll<br>
As by enchantment, an obscure retreat<br>
Opened at once, and stayed my devious feet.<br>
While thick above the rill the branches close,<br>
In rocky basin its wild waves repose,<br>
Inverted shrubs, and moss of gloomy green,<br>
Cling from the rocks, with pale wood-weeds between; <br>
And its own twilight softens the whole scene,<br>
Save where aloft the subtle sunbeams shine<br>
On withered briars that o'er the crags recline;<br>
Save where, with sparkling foam, a small cascade,<br>
Illumines, from within, the leafy shade;<br>
Beyond, along the vista of the brook,<br>
Where antique roots its bustling course o'erlook,<br>
The eye reposes on a secret bridge<br>
Half grey, half shagged with ivy to its ridge;<br>
There, bending o'er the stream, the listless swain <br>
Lingers behind his disappearing wain.<br>
&mdash;Did Sabine grace adorn my living line,<br>
Blandusia's praise, wild stream, should yield to thine!<br>
Never shall ruthless minister of death<br>
'Mid thy soft glooms the glittering steel unsheath; <br>
No goblets shall, for thee, be crowned with flowers,<br>
No kid with piteous outcry thrill thy bowers;<br>
The mystic shapes that by thy margin rove<br>
A more benignant sacrifice approve&mdash;<br>
A mind, that, in a calm angelic mood<br>
Of happy wisdom, meditating good,<br>
Beholds, of all from her high powers required,<br>
Much done, and much designed, and more desired,&mdash;<br>
Harmonious thoughts, a soul by truth refined,<br>
Entire affection for all human kind. <br><br>

  Dear Brook, farewell! To-morrow's noon again<br>
Shall hide me, wooing long thy wildwood strain;<br>
But now the sun has gained his western road,<br>
And eve's mild hour invites my steps abroad.<br><br>

  While, near the midway cliff, the silvered kite <br>
In many a whistling circle wheels her flight;<br>
Slant watery lights, from parting clouds, apace<br>
Travel along the precipice's base;<br>
Cheering its naked waste of scattered stone,<br>
By lichens grey, and scanty moss, o'ergrown; <br>
Where scarce the foxglove peeps, or thistle's beard;<br>
And restless stone-chat, all day long, is heard.<br><br>

  How pleasant, as the sun declines, to view<br>
The spacious landscape change in form and hue!<br>
Here, vanish, as in mist, before a flood<br>
Of bright obscurity, hill, lawn, and wood;<br>
There, objects, by the searching beams betrayed,<br>
Come forth, and here retire in purple shade;<br>
Even the white stems of birch, the cottage white,<br>
Soften their glare before the mellow light;<br>
The skiffs, at anchor where with umbrage wide<br>
Yon chestnuts half the latticed boat-house hide,<br>
Shed from their sides, that face the sun's slant beam,<br>
Strong flakes of radiance on the tremulous stream:<br>
Raised by yon travelling flock, a dusty cloud<br>
Mounts from the road, and spreads its moving shroud;<br>
The shepherd, all involved in wreaths of fire,<br>
Now shows a shadowy speck, and now is lost entire.<br><br>

  Into a gradual calm the breezes sink,<br>
A blue rim borders all the lake's still brink;<br>
There doth the twinkling aspen's foliage sleep,<br>
And insects clothe, like dust, the glassy deep:<br>
And now, on every side, the surface breaks<br>
Into blue spots, and slowly lengthening streaks;<br>
Here, plots of sparkling water tremble bright<br>
With thousand thousand twinkling points of light;<br>
There, waves that, hardly weltering, die away,<br>
Tip their smooth ridges with a softer ray;<br>
And now the whole wide lake in deep repose<br>
Is hushed, and like a burnished mirror glows,<br>
Save where, along the shady western marge,<br>
Coasts, with industrious oar, the charcoal barge.<br><br>

  Their panniered train a group of potters goad,<br>
Winding from side to side up the steep road;<br>
The peasant, from yon cliff of fearful edge<br>
Shot, down the headlong path darts with his sledge;<br>
Bright beams the lonely mountain-horse illume<br>
Feeding 'mid purple heath, "green rings," and broom;<br>
While the sharp slope the slackened team confounds,<br>
Downward the ponderous timber-wain resounds;<br>
In foamy breaks the rill, with merry song,<br>
Dashed o'er the rough rock, lightly leaps along;<br>
From lonesome chapel at the mountain's feet,<br>
Three humble bells their rustic chime repeat;<br>
Sounds from the water-side the hammered boat;<br>
And 'blasted' quarry thunders, heard remote!<br><br>

  Even here, amid the sweep of endless woods,<br>
Blue pomp of lakes, high cliffs and falling floods,<br>
Not undelightful are the simplest charms,<br>
Found by the grassy door of mountain-farms.<br><br>

  Sweetly ferocious, round his native walks,<br>
Pride of his sister-wives, the monarch stalks;<br>
Spur-clad his nervous feet, and firm his tread;<br>
A crest of purple tops the warrior's head.<br>
Bright sparks his black and rolling eye-ball hurls<br>
Afar, his tail he closes and unfurls;<br>
On tiptoe reared, he strains his clarion throat,<br>
Threatened by faintly-answering farms remote:<br>
Again with his shrill voice the mountain rings,<br>
While, flapped with conscious pride, resound his wings!<br><br>

  Where, mixed with graceful birch, the sombrous pine<br>
And yew-tree o'er the silver rocks recline;<br>
I love to mark the quarry's moving trains,<br>
Dwarf panniered steeds, and men, and numerous wains:<br>
How busy all the enormous hive within,<br>
While Echo dallies with its various din!<br>
Some (hear you not their chisels' clinking sound?)<br>
Toil, small as pigmies in the gulf profound;<br>
Some, dim between the lofty cliffs descried,<br>
O'erwalk the slender plank from side to side;<br>
These, by the pale-blue rocks that ceaseless ring,<br>
In airy baskets hanging, work and sing.<br><br>

  Just where a cloud above the mountain rears<br>
An edge all flame, the broadening sun appears;<br>
A long blue bar its ægis orb divides,<br>
And breaks the spreading of its golden tides;<br>
And now that orb has touched the purple steep<br>
Whose softened image penetrates the deep.<br><br>

'Cross the calm lake's blue shades the cliffs aspire, <br>
With towers and woods, a "prospect all on fire"; <br>
While coves and secret hollows, through a ray <br>
Of fainter gold, a purple gleam betray. <br>
Each slip of lawn the broken rocks between <br>
Shines in the light with more than earthly green:<br>
Deep yellow beams the scattered stems illume, <br>
Far in the level forest's central gloom: <br>
Waving his hat, the shepherd, from the vale, <br>
Directs his winding dog the cliffs to scale,&mdash; <br>
The dog, loud barking, 'mid the glittering rocks, <br>
Hunts, where his master points, the intercepted flocks.<br>
Where oaks o'erhang the road the radiance shoots <br>
On tawny earth, wild weeds, and twisted roots; <br>
The druid-stones a brightened ring unfold;<br>
And all the babbling brooks are liquid gold;<br>
Sunk to a curve, the day-star lessens still,<br>
Gives one bright glance, and drops behind the hill.<br><br>

  In these secluded vales, if village fame,<br>
Confirmed by hoary hairs, belief may claim;<br>
When up the hills, as now, retired the light,<br>
Strange apparitions mocked the shepherd's sight.<br><br>

  The form appears of one that spurs his steed<br>
Midway along the hill with desperate speed;<br>
Unhurt pursues his lengthened flight, while all<br>
Attend, at every stretch, his headlong fall.<br>
Anon, appears a brave, a gorgeous show<br>
Of horsemen-shadows moving to and fro;<br>
At intervals imperial banners stream,<br>
And now the van reflects the solar beam;<br>
The rear through iron brown betrays a sullen gleam.<br>
While silent stands the admiring crowd below,<br>
Silent the visionary warriors go,<br>
Winding in ordered pomp their upward way<br>
Till the last banner of their long array<br>
Has disappeared, and every trace is fled<br>
Of splendour&mdash;save the beacon's spiry head<br>
Tipt with eve's latest gleam of burning red.<br><br>

  Now, while the solemn evening shadows sail,<br>
On slowly-waving pinions, down the vale;<br>
And, fronting the bright west, yon oak entwines<br>
Its darkening boughs and leaves, in stronger lines;<br>
'Tis pleasant near the tranquil lake to stray<br>
Where, winding on along some secret bay,<br>
The swan uplifts his chest, and backward flings<br>
His neck, a varying arch, between his towering wings:<br>
The eye that marks the gliding creature sees<br>
How graceful, pride can be, and how majestic, ease.<br><br>

While tender cares and mild domestic loves<br>
With furtive watch pursue her as she moves,<br>
The female with a meeker charm succeeds,<br>
And her brown little-ones around her leads,<br>
Nibbling the water lilies as they pass,<br>
Or playing wanton with the floating grass.<br>
She, in a mother's care, her beauty's pride<br>
Forgetting, calls the wearied to her side;<br>
Alternately they mount her back, and rest <br>
Close by her mantling wings' embraces prest.<br><br>

  Long may they float upon this flood serene;<br>
Theirs be these holms untrodden, still, and green,<br>
Where leafy shades fence off the blustering gale,<br>
And breathes in peace the lily of the vale!<br>
Yon isle, which feels not even the milk-maid's feet,<br>
Yet hears her song, "by distance made more sweet,"<br>
Yon isle conceals their home, their hut-like bower;<br>
Green water-rushes overspread the floor;<br>
Long grass and willows form the woven wall,<br>
And swings above the roof the poplar tall.<br>
Thence issuing often with unwieldy stalk,<br>
They crush with broad black feet their flowery walk;<br>
Or, from the neighbouring water, hear at morn<br>
The hound, the horse's tread, and mellow horn;<br>
Involve their serpent-necks in changeful rings,<br>
Rolled wantonly between their slippery wings,<br>
Or, starting up with noise and rude delight,<br>
Force half upon the wave their cumbrous flight.<br><br>

  Fair Swan! by all a mother's joys caressed,<br>
Haply some wretch has eyed, and called thee blessed;<br>
When with her infants, from some shady seat<br>
By the lake's edge, she rose&mdash;to face the noontide heat;<br>
Or taught their limbs along the dusty road<br>
A few short steps to totter with their load.<br><br>

  I see her now, denied to lay her head,<br>
On cold blue nights, in hut or straw-built shed,<br>
Turn to a silent smile their sleepy cry,<br>
By pointing to the gliding moon on high.<br><br>

&mdash;When low-hung clouds each star of summer hide,<br>
And fireless are the valleys far and wide,<br>
Where the brook brawls along the public road<br>
Dark with bat-haunted ashes stretching broad,<br>
Oft has she taught them on her lap to lay<br>
The shining glow-worm; or, in heedless play,<br>
Toss it from hand to hand, disquieted;<br>
While others, not unseen, are free to shed<br>
Green unmolested light upon their mossy bed.<br><br>

  Oh! when the sleety showers her path assail,<br>
And like a torrent roars the headstrong gale;<br>
No more her breath can thaw their fingers cold,<br>
Their frozen arms her neck no more can fold;<br>
Weak roof a cowering form two babes to shield,<br>
And faint the fire a dying heart can yield!<br>
Press the sad kiss, fond mother! vainly fears<br>
Thy flooded cheek to wet them with its tears;<br>
No tears can chill them, and no bosom warms,<br>
Thy breast their death-bed, coffined in thine arms!<br><br>

  Sweet are the sounds that mingle from afar,<br>
Heard by calm lakes, as peeps the folding star,<br>
Where the duck dabbles 'mid the rustling sedge,<br>
And feeding pike starts from the water's edge,<br>
Or the swan stirs the reeds, his neck and bill<br>
Wetting, that drip upon the water still;<br>
And heron, as resounds the trodden shore,<br>
Shoots upward, darting his long neck before.<br>
<br>
  Now, with religious awe, the farewell light<br>
Blends with the solemn colouring of night;<br>
'Mid groves of clouds that crest the mountain's brow,<br>
And round the west's proud lodge their shadows throw,<br>
Like Una shining on her gloomy way,<br>
The half-seen form of Twilight roams astray;<br>
Shedding, through paly loop-holes mild and small,<br>
Gleams that upon the lake's still bosom fall;<br>
Soft o'er the surface creep those lustres pale<br>
Tracking the motions of the fitful gale.<br>
With restless interchange at once the bright<br>
Wins on the shade, the shade upon the light.<br>
No favoured eye was e'er allowed to gaze<br>
On lovelier spectacle in faery days;<br>
When gentle Spirits urged a sportive chase,<br>
Brushing with lucid wands the water's face;<br>
While music, stealing round the glimmering deeps,<br>
Charmed the tall circle of the enchanted steeps.<br>
&mdash;The lights are vanished from the watery plains:<br>
No wreck of all the pageantry remains.<br>
Unheeded night has overcome the vales:<br>
On the dark earth the wearied vision fails;<br>
The latest lingerer of the forest train,<br>
The lone black fir, forsakes the faded plain;<br>
Last evening sight, the cottage smoke, no more,<br>
Lost in the thickened darkness, glimmers hoar;<br>
And, towering from the sullen dark-brown mere,<br>
Like a black wall, the mountain-steeps appear.<br>
&mdash;Now o'er the soothed accordant heart we feel<br>
A sympathetic twilight slowly steal,<br>
And ever, as we fondly muse, we find<br>
The soft gloom deepening on the tranquil mind.<br>
Stay! pensive, sadly-pleasing visions, stay!<br>
Ah no! as fades the vale, they fade away:<br>
Yet still the tender, vacant gloom remains;<br>
Still the cold cheek its shuddering tear retains.<br><br>

  The bird, who ceased, with fading light, to thread<br>
Silent the hedge or steamy rivulet's bed,<br>
From his grey re-appearing tower shall soon<br>
Salute with gladsome note the rising moon,<br>
While with a hoary light she frosts the ground,<br>
And pours a deeper blue to Æther's bound;<br>
Pleased, as she moves, her pomp of clouds to fold<br>
In robes of azure, fleecy-white, and gold.<br><br>

  Above yon eastern hill, where darkness broods<br>
O'er all its vanished dells, and lawns, and woods;<br>
Where but a mass of shade the sight can trace,<br>
Even now she shows, half-veiled, her lovely face:<br>
Across the gloomy valley flings her light,<br>
Far to the western slopes with hamlets white;<br>
And gives, where woods the chequered upland strew,<br>
To the green corn of summer, autumn's hue.<br><br>

Thus Hope, first pouring from her blessed horn<br>
Her dawn, far lovelier than the moon's own morn,<br>
'Till higher mounted, strives in vain to cheer<br>
The weary hills, impervious, blackening near;<br>
Yet does she still, undaunted, throw the while<br>
On darling spots remote her tempting smile.<br><br>

Even now she decks for me a distant scene,<br>
(For dark and broad the gulf of time between)<br>
Gilding that cottage with her fondest ray,<br>
(Sole bourn, sole wish, sole object of my way;<br>
How fair its lawns and sheltering woods appear!<br>
How sweet its streamlet murmurs in mine ear!)<br>
Where we, my Friend, to happy days shall rise,<br>
'Till our small share of hardly-paining sighs<br>
(For sighs will ever trouble human breath)<br>
Creep hushed into the tranquil breast of death.<br><br>

But now the clear bright Moon her zenith gains,<br>
And, rimy without speck, extend the plains:<br>
The deepest cleft the mountain's front displays<br>
Scarce hides a shadow from her searching rays;<br>
From the dark-blue faint silvery threads divide<br>
The hills, while gleams below the azure tide;<br>
Time softly treads; throughout the landscape breathes<br>
A peace enlivened, not disturbed, by wreaths<br>
Of charcoal-smoke, that o'er the fallen wood,<br>
Steal down the hill, and spread along the flood.<br><br>

  The song of mountain-streams, unheard by day,<br>
Now hardly heard, beguiles my homeward way.<br>
Air listens, like the sleeping water, still,<br>
To catch the spiritual music of the hill,<br>
Broke only by the slow clock tolling deep,<br>
Or shout that wakes the ferry-man from sleep,<br>
The echoed hoof nearing the distant shore,<br>
The boat's first motion&mdash;made with dashing oar;<br>
Sound of closed gate, across the water borne,<br>
Hurrying the timid hare through rustling corn;<br>
The sportive outcry of the mocking owl;<br>
And at long intervals the mill-dog's howl;<br>
The distant forge's swinging thump profound;<br>
Or yell, in the deep woods, of lonely hound.</td>

<i>Survey of the Lakes</i>, accompanied with vouchers of its veracity, that
may amuse the reader.&mdash;W. W. 1793.<br>
<br>
The passage in Clark's folio volume, <i>A Survey of the Lakes</i>, etc.,
which suggested to Wordsworth the above lines in the <i>Evening Walk</i>, is
to be found in chapter i. of the second book, p. 55. It gives a weird
account of the appearance of horsemen being exercised in troops upon

  <blockquote>"Southen-fell side, as seen on the 25th of June 1744 by William
  Lancaster of Blakehills, and a farm servant, David Strichet:<br>
<br>
  "These visionary horsemen seemed to come from the lowest part of
  Southen-fell, and became visible just at a place called Knott. They
  then moved in regular troops along the side of the fell, till they
  came opposite Blakehills, when they went over the mountain. Then they
  described a kind of curvilinear path upon the side of the fell, and
  both these first and last appearances were bounded by the top of the
  mountain.<br>
<br>
  "Frequently the last, or last but one, in a troop would leave his
  place, and gallop to the front, and then take the same pace with the
  rest&mdash;a regular swift walk. Thus changes happened to every troop (for
  many troops appeared) and oftener than once or twice, yet not at all
  times alike.... Nor was this phenomenon seen at Blakehill only, it was
  seen by every person at every cottage within the distance of a mile.
  Neither was it confined to a momentary view, for from the time that
  Strichet first observed it, the appearance must have lasted at least
  two hours and a half, viz. from half past seven till the night coming
  on prevented further view."</blockquote>

This interesting optical illusion&mdash;which suggests the wonderful island
in the Atlantic, seen from the isles of Aran near Galway, alluded to in
the <i>Chorographical description of West, or H-Ier-Connaught</i>, of R.
O'Flaherty&mdash;was caused by the peculiar angle of the light from the
setting sun, the reflection of the water of the Solway, and the
refraction of the vapour and clouds above the Solway. These aerial and
visionary horsemen were being exercised somewhere above the
Kirkcudbright shore. It was not the first time the phenomenon had been
seen within historic times, on the same fell-side, and at the same time
of year. Canon Rawnsley writes to me,

 <blockquote> "I have an idea that the fact that it took place at midsummer eve
  (June 27), the eve of the Feast of St. John, upon which occasion the
  shepherds hereabout used to light bonfires on the hills (no doubt a
  relic of the custom of the Beltane fires of old Norse days, perhaps of
  earlier sun-worship festivals of British times), may have had
  something to do with the naming of the mountain Blencathara of which
  Southen-fell (or Shepherd's-fell, as the name implies) is part.
  Blencathara, we are told, may mean the Hill of Demons, or the haunted
  hill. My suggestion is that the old sun-worshippers, who met in
  midsummer eve on Castrigg at the Druid circle or Donn-ring, saw just
  the same phenomenon as Strichet and Lancaster saw upon Southen-fell,
  and hence the name. Nay, perhaps the Druid circle was built where it
  is, because it was well in view of the Demon Hill."</blockquote>

This Dr. John Brown&mdash;a singularly versatile English divine
(1717-1766)&mdash;was one of the first, as Wordsworth pointed put, to lead
the way to a true estimate of the English Lakes. His description of the
Vale of Keswick, in a letter to a friend, is as fine as anything in
Gray's <i>Journal</i>. Wordsworth himself quotes the lines given in this

<a href="#section4a">The Poem</a><br>

<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">This title is scarcely correct. It was during a solitary walk on the
banks of the Cam that I was first struck with this appearance, and
applied it to my own feelings in the manner here expressed, changing the
scene to the Thames, near Windsor. This, and the three stanzas of the
following poem, <i>Remembrance of Collins</i>, formed one piece; but, upon
the recommendation of Coleridge, the three last stanzas were separated
from the other.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The title of the poem in 1798, when it consisted of five stanzas, was
<i>Lines written near Richmond, upon the Thames, at Evening</i>. When, in the
edition of 1800, it was divided, the title of the first part was, <i>Lines
written when sailing in a Boat at Evening</i>; that of the second part was
<i>Lines written near Richmond upon the Thames</i>.<br>
<br>
From 1815 to 1843, both poems were placed by Wordsworth among those "of
Sentiment and Reflection." In 1845 they were transferred to "Poems
written in Youth."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<blockquote><b>To the Rev. Robert Jones, Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge</b><br>
<br>
<b>Dear Sir</b><a href="#6B"><sup>B</sup></a>,&mdash;However <a name="fr6B">desirous</a> I might have been of giving you proofs
of the high place you hold in my esteem, I should have been cautious of
wounding your delicacy by thus publicly addressing you, had not the
circumstance of our having been companions among the Alps, seemed to
give this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any scruples
which your modesty might otherwise have suggested<a href="#6C"><sup>C</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
In inscribing this little work to you, I consult my heart. You know well
how great is the difference between two companions lolling in a
post-chaise, and two travellers plodding slowly along the road, side by
side, each with his little knapsack of necessaries upon his shoulders.
How much more of heart between the two latter!<br>
<br>
I am happy in being conscious that I shall have one reader who will
approach the conclusion of these few pages with regret. You they must
certainly interest, in reminding you of moments to which you can hardly
look back without a pleasure not the less dear from a shade of
melancholy. You will meet with few images without recollecting the spot
where we observed them together; consequently, whatever is feeble in my
design, or spiritless in my colouring, will be amply supplied by your
own memory.<br>
<br>
With still greater propriety I might have inscribed to you a description
of some of the features of your native mountains, through which we have
wandered together, in the same manner, with so much pleasure. But the
sea-sunsets, which give such splendour to the vale of Clwyd, Snowdon,
the chair of Idris, the quiet village of Bethgelert, Menai and her
Druids, the Alpine steeps of the Conway, and the still more interesting
windings of the wizard stream of the Dee, remain yet untouched.
Apprehensive that my pencil may never be exercised on these subjects, I
cannot let slip this opportunity of thus publicly assuring you with how
much affection and esteem<br>
<br>
I am, dear Sir, <br>
Most sincerely yours, <br>

<span style="color: #663300;">  Much the greatest part of this poem was composed during my walks upon
  the banks of the Loire, in the years 1791, 1792. I will only notice
  that the description of the valley filled with mist, beginning&mdash;'In
  solemn shapes'&mdash;was taken from that beautiful region of which the
  principal features are Lungarn and Sarnen. Nothing that I ever saw in
  Nature left a more delightful impression on my mind than that which I
  have attempted, alas, how feebly! to convey to others in these lines.
  Those two lakes have always interested me especially, from bearing in
  their size and other features, a resemblance to those of the North of
  England. It is much to be deplored that a district so beautiful should
  be so unhealthy as it is.&mdash;I. F.</span><br><br>

<td>Were there, below, a spot of holy ground<br>
Where from distress a refuge might be found,<br>
And solitude prepare the soul for heaven;<br>
Sure, nature's God that spot to man had given<br>
Where falls the purple morning far and wide<br>
In flakes of light upon the mountain-side;<br>
Where with loud voice the power of water shakes<br>
The leafy wood, or sleeps in quiet lakes.<br><br>

 Yet not unrecompensed the man shall roam,<br>
Who at the call of summer quits his home,<br>
And plods through some wide realm o'er vale and height,<br>
Though seeking only holiday delight;<br>
At least, not owning to himself an aim<br>
To which the sage would give a prouder name.<br>
No gains too cheaply earned his fancy cloy,<br>
Though every passing zephyr whispers joy;<br>
Brisk toil, alternating with ready ease,<br>
Feeds the clear current of his sympathies.<br>
For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn;<br>
And peeps the far-off spire, his evening bourn!<br>
Dear is the forest frowning o'er his head,<br>
And dear the velvet green-sward to his tread:<br>
Moves there a cloud o'er mid-day's flaming eye?<br>
Upward he looks&mdash;"and calls it luxury:"<br>
Kind Nature's charities his steps attend;<br>
In every babbling brook he finds a friend;<br>
While chastening thoughts of sweetest use, bestowed<br>
By wisdom, moralise his pensive road.<br>
Host of his welcome inn, the noon-tide bower,<br>
To his spare meal he calls the passing poor;<br>
He views the sun uplift his golden fire,<br>
Or sink, with heart alive like Memnon's lyre;<br>
Blesses the moon that comes with kindly ray,<br>
To light him shaken by his rugged way.<br>
Back from his sight no bashful children steal;<br>
He sits a brother at the cottage-meal;<br>
His humble looks no shy restraint impart;<br>
Around him plays at will the virgin heart.<br>
While unsuspended wheels the village dance,<br>
The maidens eye him with enquiring glance,<br>
Much wondering by what fit of crazing care,<br>
Or desperate love, bewildered, he came there.<br><br>

  A hope, that prudence could not then approve,<br>
That clung to Nature with a truant's love,<br>
O'er Gallia's wastes of corn my footsteps led;<br>
Her files of road-elms, high above my head<br>
In long-drawn vista, rustling in the breeze;<br>
Or where her pathways straggle as they please<br>
By lonely farms and secret villages.<br>
But lo! the Alps ascending white in air,<br>
Toy with the sun and glitter from afar.<br><br>

  And now, emerging from the forest's gloom,<br>
I greet thee, Chartreuse, while I mourn thy doom.<br>
Whither is fled that Power whose frown severe<br>
Awed sober Reason till she crouched in fear?<br>
<i>That</i> Silence, once in deathlike fetters bound,<br>
Chains that were loosened only by the sound<br>
Of holy rites chanted in measured round?<br><br>

&mdash;The voice of blasphemy the fane alarms,<br>
The cloister startles at the gleam of arms.<br>
The thundering tube the aged angler hears,<br>
Bent o'er the groaning flood that sweeps away his tears.<br>
Cloud-piercing pine-trees nod their troubled heads,<br>
Spires, rocks, and lawns a browner night o'erspreads;<br>
Strong terror checks the female peasant's sighs, <br>
And start the astonished shades at female eyes.<br>
From Bruno's forest screams the affrighted jay,<br>
And slow the insulted eagle wheels away.<br>
A viewless flight of laughing Demons mock<br>
The Cross, by angels planted on the aërial rock. <br>
The "parting Genius" sighs with hollow breath<br>
Along the mystic streams of Life and Death.<br>
Swelling the outcry dull, that long resounds<br>
Portentous through her old woods' trackless bounds,<br>
Vallombre, 'mid her falling fanes deplores <br>
For ever broke, the sabbath of her bowers.<br><br>

  More pleased, my foot the hidden margin roves<br>
Of Como, bosomed deep in chestnut groves.<br>
No meadows thrown between, the giddy steeps<br>
Tower, bare or sylvan, from the narrow deeps. <br>
&mdash;To towns, whose shades of no rude noise complain,<br>
From ringing team apart and grating wain&mdash;<br>
To flat-roofed towns, that touch the water's bound,<br>
Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound,<br>
Or, from the bending rocks, obtrusive cling, <br>
And o'er the whitened wave their shadows fling&mdash;<br>
The pathway leads, as round the steeps it twines;<br>
And Silence loves its purple roof of vines.<br>
The loitering traveller hence, at evening, sees<br>
From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees; <br>
Or marks, 'mid opening cliffs, fair dark-eyed maids<br>
Tend the small harvest of their garden glades;<br>
Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view<br>
Stretch o'er the pictured mirror broad and blue,<br>
And track the yellow lights from steep to steep, <br>
As up the opposing hills they slowly creep.<br>
Aloft, here, half a village shines, arrayed<br>
In golden light; half hides itself in shade:<br>
While, from amid the darkened roofs, the spire,<br>
Restlessly flashing, seems to mount like fire: <br>
There, all unshaded, blazing forests throw<br>
Rich golden verdure on the lake below.<br>
Slow glides the sail along the illumined shore,<br>
And steals into the shade the lazy oar;<br>
Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs, <br>
And amorous music on the water dies.<br><br>

  How blest, delicious scene! the eye that greets<br>
Thy open beauties, or thy lone retreats;<br>
Beholds the unwearied sweep of wood that scales<br>
Thy cliffs; the endless waters of thy vales; <br>
Thy lowly cots that sprinkle all the shore,<br>
Each with its household boat beside the door;<br>
Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky;<br>
Thy towns, that cleave, like swallows' nests, on high;<br>
That glimmer hoar in eve's last light descried<br>
Dim from the twilight water's shaggy side,<br>
Whence lutes and voices down the enchanted woods<br>
Steal, and compose the oar-forgotten floods;<br>
&mdash;Thy lake, that, streaked or dappled, blue or grey,<br>
'Mid smoking woods gleams hid from morning's ray<br>
Slow-travelling down the western hills, to' enfold<br>
Its green-tinged margin in a blaze of gold;<br>
Thy glittering steeples, whence the matin bell<br>
Calls forth the woodman from his desert cell,<br>
And quickens the blithe sound of oars that pass<br>
Along the steaming lake, to early mass.<br>
But now farewell to each and all&mdash;adieu<br>
To every charm, and last and chief to you,<br>
Ye lovely maidens that in noontide shade<br>
Rest near your little plots of wheaten glade;<br>
To all that binds the soul in powerless trance,<br>
Lip-dewing song, and ringlet-tossing dance;<br>
Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume<br>
The sylvan cabin's lute-enlivened gloom.<br>
&mdash;Alas! the very murmur of the streams<br>
Breathes o'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams,<br>
While Slavery, forcing the sunk mind to dwell<br>
On joys that might disgrace the captive's cell,<br>
Her shameless timbrel shakes on Como's marge,<br>
And lures from bay to bay the vocal barge.<br><br>

  Yet are thy softer arts with power indued<br>
To soothe and cheer the poor man's solitude.<br>
By silent cottage-doors, the peasant's home<br>
Left vacant for the day, I loved to roam.<br>
But once I pierced the mazes of a wood<br>
In which a cabin undeserted stood;<br>
There an old man an olden measure scanned<br>
On a rude viol touched with withered hand.<br>
As lambs or fawns in April clustering lie<br>
Under a hoary oak's thin canopy,<br>
Stretched at his feet, with stedfast upward eye,<br>
His children's children listened to the sound;<br>
&mdash;A Hermit with his family around!<br><br>

  But let us hence; for fair Locarno smiles<br>
Embowered in walnut slopes and citron isles:<br>
Or seek at eve the banks of Tusa's stream,<br>
Where, 'mid dim towers and woods, her waters gleam.<br>
From the bright wave, in solemn gloom, retire<br>
The dull-red steeps, and, darkening still, aspire<br>
To where afar rich orange lustres glow<br>
Round undistinguished clouds, and rocks, and snow:<br>
Or, led where Via Mala's chasms confine<br>
The indignant waters of the infant Rhine,<br>
Hang o'er the abyss, whose else impervious gloom<br>
His burning eyes with fearful light illume.<br><br>

  The mind condemned, without reprieve, to go<br>
O'er life's long deserts with its charge of woe,<br>
With sad congratulation joins the train<br>
Where beasts and men together o'er the plain<br>
Move on&mdash;a mighty caravan of pain:<br>
Hope, strength, and courage, social suffering brings,<br>
Freshening the wilderness with shades and springs.<br>
&mdash;There be whose lot far otherwise is cast:<br>
Sole human tenant of the piny waste,<br>
By choice or doom a gipsy wanders here,<br>
A nursling babe her only comforter;<br>
Lo, where she sits beneath yon shaggy rock,<br>
A cowering shape half hid in curling smoke!<br><br>

  When lightning among clouds and mountain-snows<br>
Predominates, and darkness comes and goes,<br>
And the fierce torrent, at the flashes broad<br>
Starts, like a horse, beside the glaring road&mdash;<br>
She seeks a covert from the battering shower<br>
In the roofed bridge; the bridge, in that dread hour,<br>
Itself all trembling at the torrent's power.<br><br>

  Nor is she more at ease on some <i>still</i> night,<br>
When not a star supplies the comfort of its light;<br>
Only the waning moon hangs dull and red<br>
Above a melancholy mountain's head,<br>
Then sets. In total gloom the Vagrant sighs,<br>
Stoops her sick head, and shuts her weary eyes;<br>
Or on her fingers counts the distant clock,<br>
Or, to the drowsy crow of midnight cock,<br>
Listens, or quakes while from the forest's gulf<br>
Howls near and nearer yet the famished wolf.<br><br>

  From the green vale of Urseren smooth and wide<br>
Descend we now, the maddened Reuss our guide;<br>
By rocks that, shutting out the blessed day,<br>
Cling tremblingly to rocks as loose as they;<br>
By cells upon whose image, while he prays,<br>
The kneeling peasant scarcely dares to gaze;<br>
By many a votive death-cross planted near,<br>
And watered duly with the pious tear,<br>
That faded silent from the upward eye<br>
Unmoved with each rude form of peril nigh;<br>
Fixed on the anchor left by Him who saves<br>
Alike in whelming snows, and roaring waves.<br><br>

  But soon a peopled region on the sight<br>
Opens&mdash;a little world of calm delight;<br>
Where mists, suspended on the expiring gale,<br>
Spread roof like o'er the deep secluded vale,<br>
And beams of evening slipping in between,<br>
Gently illuminate a sober scene:&mdash; <br>
Here, on the brown wood-cottages they sleep,<br>
There, over rock or sloping pasture creep.<br>
On as we journey, in clear view displayed,<br>
The still vale lengthens underneath its shade<br>
Of low-hung vapour: on the freshened mead<br>
The green light sparkles;&mdash;the dim bowers recede.<br>
While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull,<br>
And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull, <br>
In solemn shapes before the admiring eye<br>
Dilated hang the misty pines on high,<br>
Huge convent domes with pinnacles and towers,<br>
And antique castles seen through gleamy showers. <br><br>

  From such romantic dreams, my soul, awake!<br>
To sterner pleasure, where, by Uri's lake<br>
In Nature's pristine majesty outspread,<br>
Winds neither road nor path for foot to tread:<br>
The rocks rise naked as a wall, or stretch,<br>
Far o'er the water, hung with groves of beech;<br>
Aerial pines from loftier steeps ascend,<br>
Nor stop but where creation seems to end.<br>
Yet here and there, if 'mid the savage scene<br>
Appears a scanty plot of smiling green,<br>
Up from the lake a zigzag path will creep<br>
To reach a small wood-hut hung boldly on the steep.<br>
&mdash;Before those thresholds (never can they know<br>
The face of traveller passing to and fro,)<br>
No peasant leans upon his pole, to tell<br>
For whom at morning tolled the funeral bell;<br>
Their watch-dog ne'er his angry bark foregoes,<br>
Touched by the beggar's moan of human woes;<br>
The shady porch ne'er offered a cool seat<br>
To pilgrims overcome by summer's heat.<br>
Yet thither the world's business finds its way<br>
At times, and tales unsought beguile the day,<br>
And <i>there</i> are those fond thoughts which Solitude,<br>
However stern, is powerless to exclude.<br>
There doth the maiden watch her lover's sail<br>
Approaching, and upbraid the tardy gale;<br>
At midnight listens till his parting oar,<br>
And its last echo, can be heard no more.<br><br>

  And what if ospreys, cormorants, herons cry,<br>
Amid tempestuous vapours driving by,<br>
Or hovering over wastes too bleak to rear<br>
That common growth of earth, the foodful ear;<br>
Where the green apple shrivels on the spray,<br>
And pines the unripened pear in summer's kindliest ray;<br>
Contentment shares the desolate domain<br>
With Independence, child of high Disdain.<br>
Exulting 'mid the winter of the skies,<br>
Shy as the jealous chamois, Freedom flies,<br>
And grasps by fits her sword, and often eyes;<br>
And sometimes, as from rock to rock she bounds<br>
The Patriot nymph starts at imagined sounds,<br>
And, wildly pausing, oft she hangs aghast,<br>
Whether some old Swiss air hath checked her haste<br>
Or thrill of Spartan fife is caught between the blast.<br><br>

  Swoln with incessant rains from hour to hour,<br>
All day the floods a deepening murmur pour:<br>
The sky is veiled, and every cheerful sight:<br>
Dark is the region as with coming night;<br>
But what a sudden burst of overpowering light!<br>
Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,<br>
Glances the wheeling eagle's glorious form!<br>
Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine<br>
The wood-crowned cliffs that o'er the lake recline;<br>
Those lofty cliffs a hundred streams unfold,<br>
At once to pillars turned that flame with gold:<br>
Behind his sail the peasant shrinks, to shun<br>
The <i>west</i>, that burns like one dilated sun,<br>
A crucible of mighty compass, felt<br>
By mountains, glowing till they seem to melt.<br><br>

  But, lo! the boatman, overawed, before<br>
The pictured fane of Tell suspends his oar;<br>
Confused the Marathonian tale appears,<br>
While his eyes sparkle with heroic tears.<br>
And who, that walks where men of ancient days<br>
Have wrought with godlike arm the deeds of praise,<br>
Feels not the spirit of the place control,<br>
Or rouse and agitate his labouring soul?<br>
Say, who, by thinking on Canadian hills,<br>
Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills,<br>
On Zutphen's plain; or on that highland dell,<br>
Through which rough Garry cleaves his way, can tell<br>
What high resolves exalt the tenderest thought<br>
Of him whom passion rivets to the spot,<br>
Where breathed the gale that caught Wolfe's happiest sigh,<br>
And the last sunbeam fell on Bayard's eye;<br>
Where bleeding Sidney from the cup retired,<br>
And glad Dundee in "faint huzzas" expired?<br><br>

 But now with other mind I stand alone<br>
Upon the summit of this naked cone,<br>
And watch the fearless chamois-hunter chase<br>
His prey, through tracts abrupt of desolate space,<br>
Through vacant worlds where Nature never gave<br>
A brook to murmur or a bough to wave,<br>
Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep;<br>
Thro' worlds where Life, and Voice, and Motion sleep;<br>
Where silent Hours their death-like sway extend,<br>
Save when the avalanche breaks loose, to rend<br>
Its way with uproar, till the ruin, drowned<br>
In some dense wood or gulf of snow profound,<br>
Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound.<br>
&mdash;'Tis his, while wandering on from height to height,<br>
To see a planet's pomp and steady light<br>
In the least star of scarce-appearing night;<br>
While the pale moon moves near him, on the bound<br>
Of ether, shining with diminished round,<br>
And far and wide the icy summits blaze,<br>
Rejoicing in the glory of her rays:<br>
To him the day-star glitters small and bright,<br>
Shorn of its beams, insufferably white,<br>
And he can look beyond the sun, and view<br>
Those fast-receding depths of sable blue<br>
Flying till vision can no more pursue!<br>
&mdash;At once bewildering mists around him close,<br>
And cold and hunger are his least of woes;<br>
The Demon of the snow, with angry roar<br>
Descending, shuts for aye his prison door.<br>
Soon with despair's whole weight his spirits sink;<br>
Bread has he none, the snow must be his drink;<br>
And, ere his eyes can close upon the day,<br>
The eagle of the Alps o'ershades her prey.<br><br>

 Now couch thyself where, heard with fear afar,<br>
Thunders through echoing pines the headlong Aar;<br>
Or rather stay to taste the mild delights<br>
Of pensive Underwalden's pastoral heights.<br>
&mdash;Is there who 'mid these awful wilds has seen<br>
The native Genii walk the mountain green?<br>
Or heard, while other worlds their charms reveal,<br>
Soft music o'er the aërial summit steal?<br>
While o'er the desert, answering every close,<br>
Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes.<br>
&mdash;And sure there is a secret Power that reigns<br>
Here, where no trace of man the spot profanes,<br>
Nought but the <i>chalets</i>, flat and bare, on high<br>
Suspended 'mid the quiet of the sky;<br>
Or distant herds that pasturing upward creep,<br>
And, not untended, climb the dangerous steep.<br>
How still! no irreligious sound or sight<br>
Rouses the soul from her severe delight.<br>
An idle voice the sabbath region fills<br>
Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills,<br>
And with that voice accords the soothing sound<br>
Of drowsy bells, for ever tinkling round;<br>
Faint wail of eagle melting into blue<br>
Beneath the cliffs, and pine-woods' steady <i>sugh</i>;<br>
The solitary heifer's deepened low;<br>
Or rumbling, heard remote, of falling snow.<br>
All motions, sounds, and voices, far and nigh,<br>
Blend in a music of tranquillity;<br>
Save when, a stranger seen below the boy<br>
Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy.<br><br>

  When, from the sunny breast of open seas,<br>
And bays with myrtle fringed, the southern breeze<br>
Comes on to gladden April with the sight<br>
Of green isles widening on each snow-clad height;<br>
When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill,<br>
And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill,<br>
The pastoral Swiss begin the cliffs to scale,<br>
Leaving to silence the deserted vale;<br>
And like the Patriarchs in their simple age<br>
Move, as the verdure leads, from stage to stage; <br>
High and more high in summer's heat they go,<br>
And hear the rattling thunder far below;<br>
Or steal beneath the mountains, half-deterred,<br>
Where huge rocks tremble to the bellowing herd.<br><br>

  One I behold who, 'cross the foaming flood,<br>
Leaps with a bound of graceful hardihood;<br>
Another high on that green ledge;&mdash;he gained<br>
The tempting spot with every sinew strained;<br>
And downward thence a knot of grass he throws,<br>
Food for his beasts in time of winter snows.<br>
&mdash;Far different life from what Tradition hoar<br>
Transmits of happier lot in times of yore!<br>
Then Summer lingered long; and honey flowed<br>
From out the rocks, the wild bees' safe abode:<br>
Continual waters welling cheered the waste, <br>
And plants were wholesome, now of deadly taste:<br>
Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had piled,<br>
Usurping where the fairest herbage smiled:<br>
Nor Hunger driven the herds from pastures bare,<br>
To climb the treacherous cliffs for scanty fare.<br>
Then the milk-thistle flourished through the land,<br>
And forced the full-swoln udder to demand,<br>
Thrice every day, the pail and welcome hand.<br>
Thus does the father to his children tell<br>
Of banished bliss, by fancy loved too well.<br>
Alas! that human guilt provoked the rod<br>
Of angry Nature to avenge her God.<br>
Still, Nature, ever just, to him imparts<br>
Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts.<br><br>

  'Tis morn: with gold the verdant mountain glows;<br>
More high, the snowy peaks with hues of rose. <br>
Far-stretched beneath the many-tinted hills,<br>
A mighty waste of mist the valley fills,<br>
A solemn sea! whose billows wide around<br>
Stand motionless, to awful silence bound: <br>
Pines, on the coast, through mist their tops uprear,<br>
That like to leaning masts of stranded ships appear.<br>
A single chasm, a gulf of gloomy blue,<br>
Gapes in the centre of the sea&mdash;and through<br>
That dark mysterious gulf ascending, sound <br>
Innumerable streams with roar profound.<br>
Mount through the nearer vapours notes of birds,<br>
And merry flageolet; the low of herds,<br>
The bark of dogs, the heifer's tinkling bell,<br>
Talk, laughter, and perchance a church-tower knell:<br>
Think not, the peasant from aloft has gazed <br>
And heard with heart unmoved, with soul unraised:<br>
Nor is his spirit less enrapt, nor less<br>
Alive to independent happiness,<br>
Then, when he lies, out-stretched, at even-tide<br>
Upon the fragrant mountain's purple side:<br>
For as the pleasures of his simple day<br>
Beyond his native valley seldom stray,<br>
Nought round its darling precincts can he find<br>
But brings some past enjoyment to his mind;<br>
While Hope, reclining upon Pleasure's urn,<br>
Binds her wild wreaths, and whispers his return.<br><br>

  Once, Man entirely free, alone and wild,<br>
Was blest as free&mdash;for he was Nature's child.<br>
He, all superior but his God disdained,<br>
Walked none restraining, and by none restrained:<br>
Confessed no law but what his reason taught,<br>
Did all he wished, and wished but what he ought.<br>
As man in his primeval dower arrayed<br>
The image of his glorious Sire displayed,<br>
Even so, by faithful Nature guarded, here<br>
The traces of primeval Man appear;<br>
The simple dignity no forms debase;<br>
The eye sublime, and surly lion-grace:<br>
The slave of none, of beasts alone the lord,<br>
His book he prizes, nor neglects his sword;<br>
&mdash;Well taught by that to feel his rights, prepared<br>
With this "the blessings he enjoys to guard."<br><br>

  And, as his native hills encircle ground<br>
For many a marvellous victory renowned,<br>
The work of Freedom daring to oppose,<br>
With few in arms, innumerable foes,<br>
When to those famous fields his steps are led,<br>
An unknown power connects him with the dead:<br>
For images of other worlds are there;<br>
Awful the light, and holy is the air.<br>
Fitfully, and in flashes, through his soul,<br>
Like sun-lit tempests, troubled transports roll;<br>
His bosom heaves, his Spirit towers amain,<br>
Beyond the senses and their little reign.<br><br>

  And oft, when that dread vision hath past by,<br>
He holds with God himself communion high,<br>
There where the peal of swelling torrents fills<br>
The sky-roofed temple of the eternal hills;<br>
Or, when upon the mountain's silent brow<br>
Reclined, he sees, above him and below,<br>
Bright stars of ice and azure fields of snow;<br>
While needle peaks of granite shooting bare<br>
Tremble in ever-varying tints of air.<br>
And when a gathering weight of shadows brown<br>
Falls on the valleys as the sun goes down;<br>
And Pikes, of darkness named and fear and storms,<br>
Uplift in quiet their illumined forms,<br>
In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread,<br>
Tinged like an angel's smile all rosy red&mdash;<br>
Awe in his breast with holiest love unites,<br>
And the near heavens impart their own delights.<br><br>

  When downward to his winter hut he goes,<br>
Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows;<br>
That hut which on the hills so oft employs<br>
His thoughts, the central point of all his joys.<br>
And as a swallow, at the hour of rest,<br>
Peeps often ere she darts into her nest,<br>
So to the homestead, where the grandsire tends<br>
A little prattling child, he oft descends,<br>
To glance a look upon the well-matched pair;<br>
Till storm and driving ice blockade him there.<br>
There, safely guarded by the woods behind,<br>
He hears the chiding of the baffled wind,<br>
Hears Winter calling all his terrors round,<br>
And, blest within himself, he shrinks not from the sound.<br><br>

  Through Nature's vale his homely pleasures glide,<br>
Unstained by envy, discontent, and pride;<br>
The bound of all his vanity, to deck,<br>
With one bright bell, a favourite heifer's neck;<br>
Well pleased upon some simple annual feast,<br>
Remembered half the year and hoped the rest,<br>
If dairy-produce, from his inner hoard,<br>
Of thrice ten summers dignify the board.<br>
&mdash;Alas! in every clime a flying ray<br>
Is all we have to cheer our wintry way;<br>
<br>
And here the unwilling mind may more than trace<br>
The general sorrows of the human race:<br>
The churlish gales of penury, that blow<br>
Cold as the north-wind o'er a waste of snow,<br>
To them the gentle groups of bliss deny<br>
That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie.<br>
Yet more;&mdash;compelled by Powers which only deign<br>
That <i>solitary</i> man disturb their reign,<br>
Powers that support an unremitting strife<br>
With all the tender charities of life,<br>
Full oft the father, when his sons have grown<br>
To manhood, seems their title to disown;<br>
And from his nest amid the storms of heaven<br>
Drives, eagle-like, those sons as he was driven;<br>
With stern composure watches to the plain&mdash;<br>
And never, eagle-like, beholds again!<br><br>

  When long familiar joys are all resigned,<br>
Why does their sad remembrance haunt the mind?<br>
Lo! where through flat Batavia's willowy groves,<br>
Or by the lazy Seine, the exile roves;<br>
O'er the curled waters Alpine measures swell,<br>
And search the affections to their inmost cell;<br>
Sweet poison spreads along the listener's veins,<br>
Turning past pleasures into mortal pains;<br>
Poison, which not a frame of steel can brave,<br>
Bows his young head with sorrow to the grave.<br><br>

  Gay lark of hope, thy silent song resume!<br>
Ye flattering eastern lights, once more the hills illume!<br>
Fresh gales and dews of life's delicious morn,<br>
And thou, lost fragrance of the heart, return!<br>
Alas! the little joy to man allowed,<br>
Fades like the lustre of an evening cloud;<br>
Or like the beauty in a flower installed,<br>
Whose season was, and cannot be recalled.<br>
Yet, when opprest by sickness, grief, or care,<br>
And taught that pain is pleasure's natural heir,<br>
We still confide in more than we can know;<br>
Death would be else the favourite friend of woe.<br><br>

  'Mid savage rocks, and seas of snow that shine,<br>
Between interminable tracts of pine,<br>
Within a temple stands an awful shrine,<br>
By an uncertain light revealed, that falls<br>
On the mute Image and the troubled walls.<br>
Oh! give not me that eye of hard disdain<br>
That views, undimmed, Ensiedlen's wretched fane.<br>
While ghastly faces through the gloom appear,<br>
Abortive joy, and hope that works in fear;<br>
While prayer contends with silenced agony,<br>
Surely in other thoughts contempt may die.<br>
If the sad grave of human ignorance bear<br>
One flower of hope&mdash;oh, pass and leave it there!<br><br>

  The tall sun, pausing on an Alpine spire,<br>
Flings o'er the wilderness a stream of fire:<br>
Now meet we other pilgrims ere the day<br>
Close on the remnant of their weary way;<br>
While they are drawing toward the sacred floor<br>
Where, so they fondly think, the worm shall gnaw no more.<br>
How gaily murmur and how sweetly taste<br>
The fountains reared for them amid the waste! <br>
Their thirst they slake:&mdash;they wash their toil-worn feet,<br>
And some with tears of joy each other greet.<br>
Yes, I must see you when ye first behold<br>
Those holy turrets tipped with evening gold,<br>
In that glad moment will for you a sigh<br>
Be heaved, of charitable sympathy;<br>
In that glad moment when your hands are prest <br>
In mute devotion on the thankful breast!<br><br>

  Last, let us turn to Chamouny that shields<br>
With rocks and gloomy woods her fertile fields:<br>
Five streams of ice amid her cots descend,<br>
And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend;&mdash;<br>
A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns<br>
Of purple lights and ever-vernal plains;<br>
Here all the seasons revel hand in hand:<br>
'Mid lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fanned<br>
They sport beneath that mountain's matchless height<br>
That holds no commerce with the summer night.<br>
From age to age, throughout his lonely bounds<br>
The crash of ruin fitfully resounds;<br>
Appalling havoc! but serene his brow,<br>
Where daylight lingers on perpetual snow;<br>
Glitter the stars, and all is black below.<br><br>

  What marvel then if many a Wanderer sigh,<br>
While roars the sullen Arve in anger by,<br>
That not for thy reward, unrivall'd Vale!<br>
Waves the ripe harvest in the autumnal gale;<br>
That thou, the slave of slaves, art doomed to pine<br>
And droop, while no Italian arts are thine,<br>
To soothe or cheer, to soften or refine.<br><br>

  Hail Freedom! whether it was mine to stray,<br>
With shrill winds whistling round my lonely way,<br>
On the bleak sides of Cumbria's heath-clad moors,<br>
Or where dank sea-weed lashes Scotland's shores;<br>
To scent the sweets of Piedmont's breathing rose,<br>
And orange gale that o'er Lugano blows;<br>
Still have I found, where Tyranny prevails,<br>
That virtue languishes and pleasure fails,<br>
While the remotest hamlets blessings share<br>
In thy loved presence known, and only there;<br>
<i>Heart</i>-blessings&mdash;outward treasures too which the eye<br>
Of the sun peeping through the clouds can spy,<br>
And every passing breeze will testify.<br>
There, to the porch, belike with jasmine bound<br>
Or woodbine wreaths, a smoother path is wound;<br>
The housewife there a brighter garden sees,<br>
Where hum on busier wing her happy bees;<br>
On infant cheeks there fresher roses blow;<br>
And grey-haired men look up with livelier brow,&mdash;<br>
To greet the traveller needing food and rest;<br>
Housed for the night, or but a half-hour's guest.<br><br>

  And oh, fair France! though now the traveller sees<br>
Thy three-striped banner fluctuate on the breeze;<br>
Though martial songs have banished songs of love,<br>
And nightingales desert the village grove,<br>
Scared by the fife and rumbling drum's alarms,<br>
And the short thunder, and the flash of arms;<br>
That cease not till night falls, when far and nigh,<br>
Sole sound, the Sourd prolongs his mournful cry!<br>
&mdash;Yet, hast thou found that Freedom spreads her power<br>
Beyond the cottage-hearth, the cottage-door:<br>
All nature smiles, and owns beneath her eyes<br>
Her fields peculiar, and peculiar skies.<br>
Yes, as I roamed where Loiret's waters glide<br>
Through rustling aspens heard from side to side,<br>
When from October clouds a milder light<br>
Fell where the blue flood rippled into white;<br>
Methought from every cot the watchful bird<br>
Crowed with ear-piercing power till then unheard;<br>
Each clacking mill, that broke the murmuring streams,<br>
Rocked the charmed thought in more delightful dreams;<br>
Chasing those pleasant dreams, the falling leaf<br>
Awoke a fainter sense of moral grief;<br>
The measured echo of the distant flail<br>
Wound in more welcome cadence down the vale;<br>
With more majestic course the water rolled,<br>
And ripening foliage shone with richer gold.<br>
&mdash;But foes are gathering&mdash;Liberty must raise<br>
Red on the hills her beacon's far-seen blaze;<br>
Must bid the tocsin ring from tower to tower!&mdash;<br>
Nearer and nearer comes the trying hour!<br>
Rejoice, brave Land, though pride's perverted ire<br>
Rouse hell's own aid, and wrap thy fields in fire:<br>
Lo, from the flames a great and glorious birth;<br>
As if a new-made heaven were hailing a new earth!<br>
&mdash;All cannot be: the promise is too fair<br>
For creatures doomed to breathe terrestrial air:<br>
Yet not for this will sober reason frown<br>
Upon that promise, not the hope disown;<br>
She knows that only from high aims ensue<br>
Rich guerdons, and to them alone are due.<br><br>

  Great God! by whom the strifes of men are weighed<br>
In an impartial balance, give thine aid<br>
To the just cause; and, oh! do thou preside<br>
Over the mighty stream now spreading wide:<br>
So shall its waters, from the heavens supplied<br>
In copious showers, from earth by wholesome springs,<br>
Brood o'er the long-parched lands with Nile-like wings!<br>
And grant that every sceptred child of clay<br>
Who cries presumptuous, "Here the flood shall stay,"<br>
May in its progress see thy guiding hand,<br>
And cease the acknowledged purpose to withstand;<br>
Or, swept in anger from the insulted shore,<br>
Sink with his servile bands, to rise no more!<br><br>

  To-night, my Friend, within this humble cot<br>
Be scorn and fear and hope alike forgot<br>
In timely sleep; and when, at break of day,<br>
On the tall peaks the glistening sunbeams play,<br>
With a light heart our course we may renew,<br>
The first whose footsteps print the mountain dew.</td>

<br>

<b>Advertisement,

Prefixed To The First Edition Of This Poem, Published
In 1842.</b><br>

<blockquote>  Not less than one-third of the following poem, though it has from time
  to time been altered in the expression, was published so far back as
  the year 1798, under the title of <i>The Female Vagrant</i>. The extract is
  of such length that an apology seems to be required for reprinting it
  here; but it was necessary to restore it to its original position, or
  the rest would have been unintelligible. The whole was written before
  the close of the year 1794, and I will detail, rather as matter of
  literary biography than for any other reason, the circumstances under
  which it was produced.<br>
<br>
  During the latter part of the summer of 1793, having passed a month in
  the Isle of Wight, in view of the fleet which was then preparing for
  sea off Portsmouth at the commencement of the war, I left the place
  with melancholy forebodings. The American war was still fresh in
  memory. The struggle which was beginning, and which many thought would
  be brought to a speedy close by the irresistible arms of Great Britain
  being added to those of the allies, I was assured in my own mind would
  be of long continuance, and productive of distress and misery beyond
  all possible calculation. This conviction was pressed upon me by
  having been a witness, during a long residence in revolutionary
  France, of the spirit which prevailed in that country. <a name="fr7A">After</a> leaving
  the Isle of Wight, I spent two<a href="#7A"><sup>A</sup></a> days in wandering on foot over
  Salisbury Plain, which, though cultivation was then widely spread
  through parts of it, had upon the whole a still more impressive
  appearance than it now retains.<br>
<br>
  The monuments and traces of antiquity, scattered in abundance over
  that region, led me unavoidably to compare what we know or guess of
  those remote times with certain aspects of modern society, and with
  calamities, principally those consequent upon war, to which, more than
  other classes of men, the poor are subject. In those reflections,
  joined with some particular facts that had come to my knowledge, the
  following stanzas originated.<br>
<br>
  In conclusion, to obviate some distraction in the minds of those who
  are well acquainted with Salisbury Plain, it may be proper to say,
  that of the features described as belonging to it, one or two are
  taken from other desolate parts of England.</blockquote><br>

<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">  Unwilling to be unnecessarily particular, I have assigned this poem
  to the dates 1793 and '94; but, in fact, much of the Female Vagrant's
  story was composed at least two years before. All that relates to her
  sufferings as a sailor's wife in America, and her condition of mind
  during her voyage home, were faithfully taken from the report made to
  me of her own case by a friend who had been subjected to the same
  trials, and affected in the same way. Mr. Coleridge, when I first
  became acquainted with him, was so much impressed with this poem, that
  it would have encouraged me to publish the whole as it then stood; but
  the mariner's fate appeared to me so tragical, as to require a
  treatment more subdued, and yet more strictly applicable in
  expression, than I had at first given to it. This fault was corrected
  nearly sixty years afterwards, when I determined to publish the whole.
  It may be worth while to remark, that, though the incidents of this
  attempt do only in a small degree produce each other, and it deviates
  accordingly from the general rule by which narrative pieces ought to
  be governed, it is not, therefore, wanting in continuous hold upon the
  mind, or in unity, which is effected by the identity of moral interest
  that places the two personages upon the same footing in the reader's
  sympathies. My ramble over many parts of Salisbury Plain put me, as
  mentioned in the preface, upon writing this poem, and left upon my
  mind imaginative impressions, the force of which I have felt to this
  day. From that district I proceeded to Bath, Bristol, and so on to the
  banks of the Wye; where I took again to travelling on foot. In
  remembrance of that part of my journey, which was in '93, I began the
  verses,&mdash;'Five years have passed,' etc.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote><br>

<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<span style="color: #555555;">The foregoing is the Fenwick note to <i>Guilt and Sorrow</i>. The note to
<i>The Female Vagrant</i>,&mdash;which was the title under which one-third of the
longer poem appeared in all the complete editions prior to 1845&mdash;is as
follows.&mdash;Ed.</span><br><br>


<hr width="25%" align="left">
<br>
 <blockquote><span style="color: #663300;"> I find the date of this is placed in 1792, in contradiction, by
  mistake, to what I have asserted in <i>Guilt and Sorrow</i>. The correct
  date is 1793-4. The chief incidents of it, more particularly her
  description of her feelings on the Atlantic, are taken from life.&mdash;I.

<hr width="25%" align="left">
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">In <a name="C-R1">1798</a> there were thirty stanzas in this poem; in 1802, twenty-six; in
1815, fourteen; in 1820, twenty-five. Stanzas I. to XXII., XXXV. to
XXXVII., and LI. to LXXIV. occur only in the collected edition of 1842,
vol. vii. (also published as "Poems, chiefly of Early and Late Years"),
and in subsequent editions. Wordsworth placed <i>The Female Vagrant</i> among
his "Juvenile Pieces" from 1815 to 1832. In <a name="fr7B">1836</a>, he included it along
with <i>Descriptive Sketches</i> in his Table of Contents<a href="#7B"><sup>B</sup></a>; but as he
numbered it IV. in the text&mdash;the other poems belonging to the "Juvenile
Pieces" being numbered I. II. and III.&mdash;it is clear that he meant it to
remain in that class. The "Poems written in Youth," of the edition of
1845, include many others in addition to the "Juvenile Pieces" of
editions 1815 to 1836.&mdash;Ed.</span><br><br>

<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">Composed in part at school at Hawkshead. The tree has disappeared,
  and the slip of Common on which it stood, that ran parallel to the
  lake, and lay open to it, has long been enclosed; so that the road has
  lost much of its attraction. This spot was my favourite walk in the
  evenings during the latter part of my school-time. The individual
  whose habits and character are here given, was a gentleman of the
  neighbourhood, a man of talent and learning, who had been educated at
  one of our Universities, and returned to pass his time in seclusion on
  his own estate. He died a bachelor in middle age. <a name="fr8B">Induced</a> by the
  beauty of the prospect, he built a small summer-house, on the rocks
  above the peninsula on which the Ferry House<a href="#8B"><sup>B</sup></a> stands. This property
  afterwards passed into the hands of the late Mr. Curwen. The site was
  long ago pointed out by Mr. West, in his <i>Guide</i>, as the pride of the
  Lakes, and now goes by the name of "The Station." So much used I to be
  delighted with the view from it, while a little boy, that some years
  before the first pleasure house was built, I led thither from
  Hawkshead a youngster about my own age, an Irish boy, who was a
  servant to an itinerant conjurer. My notion was to witness the
  pleasure I expected the boy would receive from the prospect of the
  islands below and the intermingling water. I was not disappointed; and
  I hope the fact, insignificant as it may appear to some, may be
  thought worthy of note by others who may cast their eye over these
  notes.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote><br>

<td>Nay, Traveller! rest. This lonely Yew-tree stands<br>
Far from all human dwelling: what if here<br>
No sparkling rivulet spread the verdant herb?<br>
What if the bee love not these barren boughs?<br>
Yet, if the wind breathe soft, the curling waves,<br>
That break against the shore, shall lull thy mind<br>
By one soft impulse saved from vacancy.<br>

That piled these stones and with the mossy sod<br>
First covered, and here taught this aged Tree<br>
With its dark arms to form a circling bower,<br>
I well remember.&mdash;He was one who owned<br>
No common soul. In youth by science nursed,<br>
And led by nature into a wild scene<br>
Of lofty hopes, he to the world went forth <br>
A favoured Being, knowing no desire<br>
Which genius did not hallow; 'gainst the taint<br>
Of dissolute tongues, and jealousy, and hate,<br>
And scorn,&mdash;against all enemies prepared,<br>
All but neglect. The world, for so it thought,<br>
Owed him no service; wherefore he at once<br>
With indignation turned himself away,<br>
And with the food of pride sustained his soul<br>
In solitude.&mdash;Stranger! these gloomy boughs<br>
Had charms for him; and here he loved to sit,<br>
His only visitants a straggling sheep,<br>
The stone-chat, or the glancing sand-piper:<br>
And on these barren rocks, with fern and heath,<br>
And juniper and thistle, sprinkled o'er,<br>
Fixing his downcast eye, he many an hour <br>
A morbid pleasure nourished, tracing here<br>
An emblem of his own unfruitful life:<br>
And, lifting up his head, he then would gaze<br>
On the more distant scene,&mdash;how lovely 'tis<br>
Thou seest,&mdash;and he would gaze till it became <br>
Far lovelier, and his heart could not sustain<br>
The beauty, still more beauteous! Nor, that time,<br>
When nature had subdued him to herself,<br>
Would he forget those Beings to whose minds<br>
Warm from the labours of benevolence <br>
The world, and human life, appeared a scene<br>
Of kindred loveliness: then he would sigh,<br>
Inly disturbed, to think that others felt<br>
What he must never feel: and so, lost Man!<br>
On visionary views would fancy feed, <br>
Till his eye streamed with tears. In this deep vale<br>
He died,&mdash;this seat his only monument.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If Thou be one whose heart the holy forms<br>
Of young imagination have kept pure,<br>
Stranger! henceforth be warned; and know that pride,<br>
Howe'er disguised in its own majesty, <br>
Is littleness; that he who feels contempt<br>
For any living thing, hath faculties<br>
Which he has never used; that thought with him<br>
Is in its infancy. The man whose eye <br>
Is ever on himself doth look on one,<br>
The least of Nature's works, one who might move<br>
The wise man to that scorn which wisdom holds<br>
Unlawful, ever. O be wiser, Thou!<br>
Instructed that true knowledge leads to love; <br>
True dignity abides with him alone<br>
Who, in the silent hour of inward thought,<br>
Can still suspect, and still revere himself,<br>
In lowliness of heart.</td>

<span style="color: #555555;">The place where this Yew-tree stood may be found without difficulty. It
was about three-quarters of a mile from Hawkshead, on the eastern shore
of the lake, a little to the left above the present highway, as one goes
towards Sawrey. Mr. Bowman, the son of Wordsworth's last teacher at the
grammar-school of Hawkshead, told me that it stood about forty yards
nearer the village than the yew which is now on the roadside, and is
sometimes called "Wordsworth's Yew." In the poet's school-days the road
passed right through the unenclosed common, and the tree was a
conspicuous object. It was removed, he says, owing to the popular belief
that its leaves were poisonous, and might injure the cattle grazing in
the common. The present tree is erroneously called "Wordsworth's Yew."
Its proximity to the place where the tree of the poem stood has given
rise to the local tradition.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

February 28, 1842<a href="#9B"><sup>B</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
  This Dramatic Piece, as noted in its title-page, was composed in
  1795-6. It lay nearly from that time till within the last two or three
  months unregarded among my papers, without being mentioned even to my
  most intimate friends. Having, however, impressions upon my mind which
  made me unwilling to destroy the MS., I determined to undertake the
  responsibility of publishing it during my own life, rather than impose
  upon my successors the task of deciding its fate. Accordingly it has
  been revised with some care; but, as it was at first written, and is
  now published, without any view to its exhibition upon the stage, not
  the slightest alteration has been made in the conduct of the story, or
  the composition of the characters; above all, in respect to the two
  leading Persons of the Drama, I felt no inducement to make any change.
  The study of human nature suggests this awful truth, that, as in the
  trials to which life subjects us, sin and crime are apt to start from
  their very opposite qualities, so there are no limits to the hardening
  of the heart, and the perversion of the understanding to which they
  may carry their slaves. During my long residence in France, while the
  Revolution was rapidly advancing to its extreme of wickedness, I <a name="fr9C">had</a>
  frequent opportunities of being an eye-witness of this process, and it
  was while that knowledge was fresh upon my memory, that the Tragedy of
  'The Borderers' was composed<a href="#9C"><sup>C</sup></a>.
<br>
<br>

<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>

<span style="color: #663300;">Of this dramatic work I have little to say in addition to the short
  printed note which will be found attached to it. It was composed at
  Racedown, in Dorset, during the latter part of the year 1795, and in
  the following year. Had it been the work of a later period of life, it
  would have been different in some respects from what it is now. The
  plot would have been something more complex, and a greater variety of
  characters introduced to relieve the mind from the pressure of
  incidents so mournful. The manners also would have been more attended
  to. My care was almost exclusively given to the passions and the
  characters, and the position in which the persons in the drama stood
  relatively to each other, that the reader (for I had then no thought
  of the stage) might be moved, and to a degree instructed, by lights
  penetrating somewhat into the depths of our nature. In this endeavour,
  I cannot think, upon a very late review, that I have failed. As to the
  scene and period of action, little more was required for my purpose
  than the absence of established law and government, so that the agents
  might be at liberty to act on their own impulses. Nevertheless, I do
  remember, that having a wish to colour the manners in some degree from
  local history more than my knowledge enabled me to do, I read
  Redpath's <i>History of the Borders</i>, but found there nothing to my
  purpose. I once made an observation to Sir W. Scott, in which he
  concurred, that it was difficult to conceive how so dull a book could
  be written on such a subject. Much about the same time, but little
  after, Coleridge was employed in writing his tragedy of <i>Remorse</i>; and
  it happened that soon after, through one of the Mr. Poole's, Mr.
  Knight, the actor, heard that we had been engaged in writing plays,
  and upon his suggestion, mine was curtailed, and I believe Coleridge's
  also, was offered to Mr. Harris, manager of Covent Garden. For myself,
  I had no hope, nor even a wish (though a successful play would in the
  then state of my finances have been a most welcome piece of good
  fortune), that he should accept my performance; so that I incurred no
  disappointment when the piece was <i>judiciously</i> returned as not
  calculated for the stage. In this judgment I entirely concurred: and
  had it been otherwise, it was so natural for me to shrink from public
  notice, that any hope I might have had of success would not have
  reconciled me altogether to such an exhibition. Mr. C.'s play was, as
  is well known, brought forward several years after, through the
  kindness of Mr. Sheridan. In conclusion, I may observe, that while I
  was composing this play, I wrote a short essay, illustrative of that
  constitution and those tendencies of human nature which make the
  apparently <i>motiveless</i> actions of bad men intelligible to careful
  observers. This was partly done with reference to the character of
  Oswald, and his persevering endeavour to lead the man he disliked into
  so heinous a crime; but still more to preserve in my distinct
  remembrance, what I had observed of transitions in character, and the
  reflections I had been led to make, during the time I was a witness of
  the changes through which the French Revolution passed.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote><br>

Makes up one damning falsehood. Leave him here<br>
To cold and hunger!&mdash;Pain is of the heart,<br>
And what are a few throes of bodily suffering<br>
If they can waken one pang of remorse?<br>

<span style="color: #555555;">In June 1797 Coleridge wrote to his friend Cottle: </span>

 <blockquote> "W. has written a tragedy himself. I speak with heart-felt sincerity,
  and, I think, unblinded judgment, when I tell you that I feel myself a
  little man by his side, and yet I do not think myself a less man than
  I formerly thought myself. His drama is absolutely wonderful. You know
  I do not commonly speak in such abrupt and unmingled phrases, and
  therefore will the more readily believe me. There are in the piece
  those profound touches of the human heart which I find three or four
  times in the <i>Robbers</i> of Schiller, and often in Shakspeare; but in W.
  there are no inequalities."</blockquote>


<span style="color: #555555;">On August 6, 1800, Charles Lamb wrote to Coleridge: </span>

  <blockquote>"I would pay five-and-forty thousand carriages to read W.'s tragedy,
  of which I have heard so much and seen so little." Shortly afterwards,
  August 26, he wrote to Coleridge: "I have a sort of a recollection
  that somebody, I think <i>you</i>, promised me a sight of Wordsworth's
  tragedy. I shall be very glad of it just now, for I have got Manning
  with me, and should like to read it _with him_. But this, I confess,
  is a refinement. Under any circumstances, alone, in Cold-Bath Prison,
  or in the desert island, just when Prospero and his crew had set off,
  with Caliban in a cage, to Milan, it would be a treat to me to read
  that play. Manning has read it, so has Lloyd, and all Lloyd's family;
  but I could not get him to betray his trust by giving me a sight of
  it. Lloyd is sadly deficient in some of those virtuous vices."<span style="color: #555555;">&mdash;Ed.</span></blockquote><br>

<br>
The preceding Fenwick note to this poem is manifestly inaccurate as to
date, since the poem is printed in the "Lyrical Ballads" of 1800. In the
edition of 1836 the date of composition is given as 1797, and this date
is followed by Mr. Carter, the editor of 1857. Miss Wordsworth's Journal
gives no date; and, as the Fenwick note is certainly incorrect&mdash;and the
poem must have been written before the edition of 1800 came out&mdash; it
seems best to trust to the date sanctioned by Wordsworth himself in
1836, and followed by his literary executor in 1857. I think it probable
that the poem was written during the short visit which Wordsworth and
his sister paid to their brother Richard in London in 1797, when he
tried to get his tragedy, <i>The Borderers</i>, brought on the stage. The
title of the poem from 1800 to 1805 was <i>Poor Susan</i>.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

  conduct. Susan is a servant maid. I see her trundling her mop, and
  contemplating the whirling phenomenon through blurred optics; but to

  no better than she should be, which I trust was not what you meant to

<a href="#section13a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">  Written at Alfoxden in the spring of 1798, under circumstances
  somewhat remarkable. The little girl who is the heroine, I met within
  the area of Goodrich Castle in the year 1793. Having left the Isle of
  Wight, and crost Salisbury Plain, as mentioned in the preface to
  <i>Guilt and Sorrow</i>, I proceeded by Bristol up the Wye, and so on to N.
  Wales to the Vale of Clwydd, where I spent my summer under the roof of
  the father of my friend, Robert Jones.<br>
<br>
  In reference to this poem, I will here mention one of the most
  remarkable facts in my own poetic history, and that of Mr. Coleridge.
  In the spring of the year 1798, he, my sister, and myself, started
  from Alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon, with a view to visit
  Linton and the Valley of Stones near it; and as our united funds were
  very small, we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a
  poem, to be sent to the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, set up by Philips, the
  bookseller, and edited by Dr. Aikin. Accordingly we set off, and
  proceeded along the Quantock Hills, towards Watchet; and in the course
  of this walk was planned the poem of <i>The Ancient Mariner</i>, founded on
  a dream, as Mr. Coleridge said, of his friend Mr. Cruikshank. Much the
  greatest part of the story was Mr. Coleridge's invention; but certain
  parts I myself suggested: for example, some crime was to be committed
  which should bring upon the Old Navigator, as Coleridge afterwards
  delighted to call him, the spectral persecution, as a consequence of
  that crime, and his own wanderings. I had been reading in Shelvocke's
  <i>Voyages</i>, a day or two before, that, while doubling Cape Horn, they
  frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude, the largest sort of
  sea-fowl, some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet.
  'Suppose,' said I, 'you represent him as having killed one of these
  birds on entering the South Sea, and that the tutelary spirits of
  these regions take upon them to avenge the crime.' The incident was
  thought fit for the purpose, and adopted accordingly. I also suggested
  the navigation of the ship by the dead men, but do not recollect that
  I had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem. The gloss with
  which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of
  us at the time; at least not a hint of it was given to me, and I have
  no doubt it was a gratuitous after-thought. We began the composition
  together, on that to me memorable evening: I furnished two or three
  lines at the beginning of the poem, in particular&mdash;</span>

<blockquote>And listen'd like a three years' child;<br>
    The Mariner had his will.</blockquote>

  <span style="color: #663300;">These trifling contributions, all but one (which Mr. C. has with
  unnecessary scrupulosity recorded), slipt out of his mind, as well
  they might. As we endeavoured to proceed conjointly (I speak of the
  same evening), our respective manners proved so widely different, that
  it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but
  separate from an undertaking upon which I could only have been a clog.
  We returned after a few days from a delightful tour, of which I have
  many pleasant, and some of them droll enough, recollections. We
  returned by Dulverton to Alfoxden. <i>The Ancient Mariner</i> grew and grew
  till it became too important for our first object, which was limited
  to our expectation of five pounds; and we began to talk of a volume
  which was to consist, as Mr. Coleridge has told the world, of Poems
  chiefly on natural subjects taken from common life, but looked at, as
  much as might be, through an imaginative medium. Accordingly I wrote
  <i>The Idiot Boy</i>, <i>Her eyes are wild</i>, etc., <i>We are Seven</i>, <i>The
  Thorn</i>, and some others. To return to <i>We are Seven</i>, the piece that
  called forth this note, I composed it while walking in the grove at
  Alfoxden. My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate, that
  while walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first, having
  begun with the last line. When it was all but finished, I came in and
  recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my sister, and said, "A prefatory
  stanza must be added, and I should sit down to our little tea-meal
  with greater pleasure if my task was finished." I mentioned in
  substance what I wished to be expressed, and Coleridge immediately
  threw off the stanza, thus;</span>

<blockquote>A little child, dear brother Jem,</blockquote>

  <span style="color: #663300;">I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jem,' as being ludicrous; but
  we all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend James Tobin's name,
  who was familiarly called Jem. He was the brother of the dramatist;
  and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to
  notice. The said Jem got a sight of the "Lyrical Ballads" as it was
  going through the press at Bristol, during which time I was residing
  in that city. One evening he came to me with a grave face, and said,
  "Wordsworth, I have seen the volume that Coleridge and you are about
  to publish. There is one poem in it which I earnestly entreat you will
  cancel, for, if published, it will make you everlastingly ridiculous."
  I answered, that I felt much obliged by the interest he took in my
  good name as a writer, and begged to know what was the unfortunate
  piece he alluded to. He said, 'It is called <i>We are Seven</i>.' 'Nay,'
  said I, 'that shall take its chance, however'; and he left me in
  despair. I <a name="fr13A">have</a> only to add, that in the spring<a href="#13A"><sup>A</sup></a> of 1841, I
  revisited Goodrich Castle, not having seen that part of the Wye since
  I met the little girl there in 1793. It would have given me greater
  pleasure to have found in the neighbouring hamlet traces of one who
  had interested me so much, but that was impossible, as unfortunately I
  did not even know her name. The ruin, from its position and features,
  is a most impressive object. I could not but deeply regret that its
  solemnity was impaired by a fantastic new Castle set up on a
  projection of the same ridge, as if to show how far modern art can go
  in surpassing all that could be done by antiquity and nature with
  their united graces, remembrances, and associations. I could have
  almost wished for power, so much the contrast vexed me, to blow away
  Sir &mdash;&mdash; Meyrick's impertinent structure and all the fopperies it
  contains.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote><br>

<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">The "structure" referred to is Goodrich Court, built in 1828 by Sir
Samuel Rush Meyrick&mdash;a collector of ancient armour, and a great
authority on the subject&mdash;mainly to receive his extensive private
collection. The armour has been removed from Goodrich to the South
Kensington Museum. <i>We are Seven</i> was placed by Wordsworth among his
"Poems referring to the Period of Childhood."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>&mdash;A simple Child,<br>
That lightly draws its breath,<br>
And feels its life in every limb,<br>
What should it know of death?<br><br>

I met a little cottage Girl:<br>
She was eight years old, she said;<br>
Her hair was thick with many a curl<br>
That clustered round her head.<br><br>

She had a rustic, woodland air,<br>
And she was wildly clad:<br>
Her eyes were fair, and very fair;<br>
&mdash;Her beauty made me glad.<br><br>

"Sisters and brothers, little Maid,<br>
How many may you be?"<br>
"How many? Seven in all," she said,<br>
And wondering looked at me.<br><br>

"And where are they? I pray you tell."<br>
She answered, "Seven are we;<br>
And two of us at Conway dwell,<br>
And two are gone to sea.<br><br>

"Two of us in the church-yard lie,<br>
My sister and my brother;<br>
And, in the church-yard cottage, I<br>
Dwell near them with my mother."<br><br>

"You say that two at Conway dwell,<br>
And two are gone to sea,<br>
Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell,<br>
Sweet Maid, how this may be."<br><br>

Then did the little Maid reply,<br>
"Seven boys and girls are we; <br>
Two of us in the church-yard lie,<br>
Beneath the church-yard tree."<br><br>

"You run about, my little Maid,<br>
Your limbs they are alive;<br>
If two are in the church-yard laid,<br>
Then ye are only five."<br><br>

"Their graves are green, they may be seen,"<br>
The little Maid replied,<br>
"Twelve steps or more from my mother's door,<br>
And they are side by side.<br><br>

"My stockings there I often knit,<br>
My kerchief there I hem;<br>
And there upon the ground I sit,<br>
And sing a song to them.<br><br>

"And often after sun-set, Sir,<br>
When it is light and fair,<br>
I take my little porringer,<br>
And eat my supper there.<br><br>

"The first that died was sister Jane;<br>
In bed she moaning lay,<br>
Till God released her of her pain;<br>
And then she went away.<br><br>

"So in the church-yard she was laid;<br>
And, when the grass was dry,<br>
Together round her grave we played,<br>
My brother John and I.<br><br>

"And when the ground was white with snow,<br>
And I could run and slide,<br>
My brother John was forced to go,<br>
And he lies by her side."<br><br>

"How many are you, then," said I,<br>
"If they two are in heaven?"<br>
Quick was the little Maid's reply,<br>
"O Master! we are seven."<br><br>

"But they are dead; those two are dead!<br>
Their spirits are in heaven!"<br>
'Twas throwing words away; for still<br>
The little Maid would have her will,<br>
And said, "Nay, we are seven!"</td>

<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">This was suggested in front of Alfoxden. The boy was a son of my
  friend, Basil Montagu, who had been two or three years under our care.
  The name of Kilve is from a village on the Bristol Channel, about a
  mile from Alfoxden; and the name of Liswyn Farm was taken from a
  beautiful spot on the Wye, where Mr. Coleridge, my sister, and I had
  been visiting the famous John Thelwall, who had taken refuge from
  politics, after a trial for high treason, with a view to bring up his
  family by the profits of agriculture, which proved as unfortunate a
  speculation as that he had fled from. Coleridge and he had both been
  public lecturers; Coleridge mingling, with his politics, Theology,
  from which the other elocutionist abstained, unless it was for the
  sake of a sneer. This quondam community of public employment induced
  Thelwall to visit Coleridge at Nether Stowey, where he fell in my way.
  He really was a man of extraordinary talent, an affectionate husband,
  and a good father. Though brought up in the city, on a tailor's board,
  he was truly sensible of the beauty of natural objects. I remember
  once, when Coleridge, he, and I were seated together upon the turf, on
  the brink of a stream in the most beautiful part of the most beautiful
  glen of Alfoxden, Coleridge exclaimed, 'This is a place to reconcile
  one to all the jarrings and conflicts of the wide world.' 'Nay,' said
  Thelwall, 'to make one forget them altogether.' The visit of this man
  to Coleridge was, as I believe Coleridge has related, the occasion of
  a spy being sent by Government to watch our proceedings; which were, I
  can say with truth, such as the world at large would have thought
  ludicrously harmless.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote><br>

<td>I have a boy of five years old;<br>
His face is fair and fresh to see;<br>
His limbs are cast in beauty's mould,<br>
And dearly he loves me.<br><br>

One morn we strolled on our dry walk,<br>
Our quiet home all full in view,<br>
And held such intermitted talk<br>
As we are wont to do.<br><br>

My thoughts on former pleasures ran;<br>
I thought of Kilve's delightful shore,<br>
Our pleasant home when spring began,<br>
A long, long year before.<br><br>

A day it was when I could bear<br>
Some fond regrets to entertain;<br>
With so much happiness to spare,<br>
I could not feel a pain.<br><br>

The green earth echoed to the feet<br>
Of lambs that bounded through the glade,<br>
From shade to sunshine, and as fleet<br>
From sunshine back to shade.<br><br>

Birds warbled round me&mdash;and each trace<br>
Of inward sadness had its charm;<br>
Kilve, thought I, was a favoured place,<br>
And so is Liswyn farm.<br><br>

My boy beside me tripped, so slim<br>
And graceful in his rustic dress!<br>
And, as we talked, I questioned him,<br>
In very idleness.<br><br>

"Now tell me, had you rather be,"<br>
I said, and took him by the arm,<br>
"On Kilve's smooth shore, by the green sea,<br>
Or here at Liswyn farm?"<br><br>

In careless mood he looked at me,<br>
While still I held him by the arm,<br>
And said, "At Kilve I'd rather be<br>
Than here at Liswyn farm."<br><br>

"Now, little Edward, say why so:<br>
My little Edward, tell me why."&mdash;<br>
"I cannot tell, I do not know."&mdash;<br>
"Why, this is strange," said I;<br><br>

"For, here are woods, hills smooth and warm:<br>
There surely must some reason be<br>
Why you would change sweet Liswyn farm<br>
For Kilve by the green sea."<br><br>

At this, my boy hung down his head,<br>
He blushed with shame, nor made reply;<br>
And three times to the child I said,<br>
"Why, Edward, tell me why?"<br><br>

His head he raised&mdash;there was in sight,<br>
It caught his eye, he saw it plain&mdash;<br>
Upon the house-top, glittering bright,<br>
A broad and gilded vane.<br><br>

Then did the boy his tongue unlock,<br>
And eased his mind with this reply:<br>
"At Kilve there was no weather-cock;<br>
And that's the reason why."<br><br>

O dearest, dearest boy! my heart<br>
For better lore would seldom yearn,<br>
Could I but teach the hundredth part<br>
Of what from thee I learn.</td>

  <blockquote>"The Fenwick note is most puzzling.
  <ol type="1">

  <li>If Coleridge went to visit Thelwall, with Wordsworth and Dorothy in
  July 1798, this is the only record; but I suppose that he did.</li>

  <li>How could the poem have been suggested in front of Alfoxden? The
  visit to Liswyn took place after the Wordsworths had left Alfoxden
  never to return. If little Montagu ever did compare Kilve and Liswyn
  Farm, he must have done so after he left Alfoxden. The scene is laid
  at Liswyn, and if the poem was written at Alfoxden, before the party
  visited Liswyn, the supposed reply was invented to a supposed question
  which might be put to the child when he got to Liswyn. How unlike
  Wordsworth.</li>

  <li>Thelwall came to Alfoxden at the commencement of Wordsworth's
  tenancy; and the visit to Wales took place when the tenancy was over,
  July 3-10."</li>

<h2><a name="section16">The Thorn</a></h2>

<h4>Composed March 19, 1798.&mdash;Published 1798.</h4>

<a href="#section16a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">In the editions of 1800-1805, Wordsworth added the following note to
this poem:</span>

<blockquote>  "This Poem ought to have been preceded by an introductory Poem, which
  I have been prevented from writing by never having felt myself in a
  mood when it was probable that I should write it well.&mdash;The character
  which I have here introduced speaking is sufficiently common. The
  Reader will perhaps have a general notion of it, if he has ever known
  a man, a Captain of a small trading vessel for example, who being past
  the middle age of life, had retired upon an annuity or small
  independent income to some village or country town of which he was not
  a native, or in which he had not been accustomed to live. Such men
  having little to do become credulous and talkative from indolence; and
  from the same cause, and other predisposing causes by which it is
  probable that such men may have been affected, they are prone to
  superstition. On which account it appeared to me proper to select a
  character like this to exhibit some of the general laws by which
  superstition acts upon the mind. Superstitious men are almost always
  men of slow faculties and deep feelings; their minds are not loose but
  adhesive; they have a reasonable share of imagination, by which word I
  mean the faculty which produces impressive effects out of simple
  elements; but they are utterly destitute of fancy, the power by which
  pleasure and surprise are excited by sudden varieties of situation and
  by accumulated imagery.<br>
<br>
  "It was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such men
  cleave to the same ideas; and to follow the turns of passion, always
  different, yet not palpably different, by which their conversation is
  swayed. I had two objects to attain; first, to represent a picture
  which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with the character
  that should describe it, secondly, while I adhered to the style in
  which such persons describe, to take care that words, which in their
  minds are impregnated with passion, should likewise convey passion to
  Readers who are not accustomed to sympathize with men feeling in that
  manner or using such language. It seemed to me that this might be done
  by calling in the assistance of Lyrical and rapid Metre. It was
  necessary that the Poem, to be natural, should in reality move slowly;
  yet I hoped, that, by the aid of the metre, to those who should at all
  enter into the spirit of the Poem, it would appear to move quickly.
  The Reader will have the kindness to excuse this note as I am sensible
  that an introductory Poem is necessary to give this Poem its full
  effect.<br>
<br>
  "Upon this occasion I will request permission to add a few words
  closely connected with <i>The Thorn</i> and many other Poems in these
  Volumes. There is a numerous class of readers who imagine that the
  same words cannot be repeated without tautology; this is a great
  error: virtual tautology is much oftener produced by using different
  words when the meaning is exactly the same. Words, a Poet's words more
  particularly, ought to be weighed in the balance of feeling and not
  measured by the space which they occupy upon paper. For the Reader
  cannot be too often reminded that Poetry is passion: it is the history
  or science of feelings: now every man must know that an attempt is
  rarely made to communicate impassioned feelings without something of
  an accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness of our own powers,
  or the deficiencies of language. During such efforts there will be a
  craving in the mind, and as long as it is unsatisfied the Speaker will
  cling to the same words, or words of the same character. There are
  also various other reasons why repetition and apparent tautology are
  frequently beauties of the highest kind. Among the chief of these
  reasons is the interest which the mind attaches to words, not only as
  symbols of the passion, but as <i>things</i>, active and efficient, which
  are of themselves part of the passion. And further, from a spirit of
  fondness, exultation, and gratitude, the mind luxuriates in the
  repetition of words which appear successfully to communicate its
  feelings. The truth of these remarks might be shown by innumerable
  passages from the Bible and from the impassioned poetry of every
  nation.

<blockquote>Awake, awake, Deborah! awake, awake, utter a song: Arise Barak, and
    lead captivity captive, thou Son of Abinoam.<br>
<br>
    At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he
    fell: where he bowed there he fell down dead.<br>
<br>
    Why is his Chariot so long in coming? why tarry the Wheels of his
    Chariot?<br>
<br>
    (<i>Judges</i>, chap. v. verses 12th, 27th, and part of 28th.)</blockquote>

See also the whole of that tumultuous and wonderful Poem.<br>
<br>
  "The poem of 'The Thorn', as the reader will soon discover, is not
  supposed to be spoken in the author's own person: the character of the
  loquacious narrator will sufficiently shew itself in the course of the
  story."</blockquote>

W. W. Advertisement to "Lyrical Ballads," 1798.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">Alfoxden, 1798. Arose out of my observing, on the ridge of Quantock
  Hill, on a stormy day, a thorn, which I had often past in calm and
  bright weather, without noticing it. I said to myself, "Cannot I by
  some invention do as much to make this Thorn permanently as an
  impressive object as the storm has made it to my eyes at this moment?"
  I began the poem accordingly, and composed it with great rapidity. Sir
  George Beaumont painted a picture from it, which Wilkie thought his
  best. He gave it me: though when he saw it several times at Rydal
  Mount afterwards, he said, 'I could make a better, and would like to
  paint the same subject over again.' The sky in this picture is nobly
  done, but it reminds one too much of Wilson. The only fault, however,
  of any consequence is the female figure, which is too old and decrepit
  for one likely to frequent an eminence on such a call.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote>

</span>
 <blockquote> "Are ye sure ye ken the way ye are taking us?" said Jeanie, who began
  to imagine that she was getting deeper into the woods, and more remote
  from the highroad.<br>
<br>
  "Do I ken the road? Wasna I mony a day living here, and what for
  shouldna I ken the road? I might hae forgotten, too, for it was afore
  my accident; but there are some things ane can never forget, let them
  try it as muckle as they like."<br>
<br>
  By this time they had gained the deepest part of a patch of woodland.
  The trees were a little separated from each other, and at the foot of
  one of them, a beautiful poplar, was a hillock of moss, such as the
  poet of Grasmere has described in the motto to our chapter. So soon as
  she arrived at this spot, Madge Wildfire, joining her hands above her
  head, with a loud scream that resembled laughter, flung herself all at
  once upon the spot, and remained there lying motionless.<br>
<br>
  Jeanie's first idea was to take the opportunity of flight; but her
  desire to escape yielded for a moment to apprehension for the poor
  insane being, who, she thought, might perish for want of relief. With
  an effort, which, in her circumstances, might be termed heroic, she
  stooped down, spoke in a soothing tone, and tried to raise up the
  forlorn creature. She effected this with difficulty, and as she placed
  her against the tree in a sitting posture, she observed with surprise,
  that her complexion, usually florid, was now deadly pale, and that her
  face was bathed in tears. Notwithstanding her own extreme danger,
  Jeanie was affected by the situation of her companion; and the rather
  that, through the whole train of her wavering and inconsistent state
  of mind and line of conduct, she discerned a general colour of
  kindness towards herself, for which she felt gratitude.<br>
<br>
  "Let me alane!&mdash;let me alane!" said the poor young woman, as her
  paroxysm of sorrow began to abate. "Let me alane; it does me good to
  weep. I canna shed tears but maybe anes or twice a-year, and I aye
  come to wet this turf with them, that the flowers may grow fair, and
  the grass may be green."<br>
<br>
  "But what is the matter with you?" said Jeanie. "Why do you weep so
  bitterly?"<br>
<br>
  "There's matter enow," replied the lunatic; "mair than ae puir mind
  can bear, I trow. Stay a bit, and I'll tell you a' about it; for I
  like ye, Jeanie Deans; a'body spoke weel about ye when we lived in the
  Pleasaunts. And I mind aye the drink o' milk ye gae me yon day, when I
  had been on Arthur's Seat for four-and-twenty hours, looking for the
  ship that somebody was sailing in."</blockquote>

<br>
  <blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">Written at Alfoxden. The incident from Dr. Darwin's 'Zoönomia'.&mdash;I.
  F.</span></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">See Erasmus Darwin's <i>Zoönomia</i>, vol. iv. pp. 68-69, ed. 1801. It is the
story of a man named Tullis, narrated by an Italian, Signer L. Storgosi,
in a work called <i>Il Narratore Italiano</i>.</span>

  <blockquote>"I received good information of the truth of the following case, which
  was published a few years ago in the newspapers. A young farmer in
  Warwickshire, finding his hedges broke, and the sticks carried away
  during a frosty season, determined to watch for the thief. He lay many
  cold hours under a haystack, and at length an old woman, like a witch
  in a play, approached, and began to pull up the hedge; he waited till
  she had tied up her bundle of sticks, and was carrying them off, that
  he might convict her of the theft, and then springing from his
  concealment, he seized his prey with violent threats. After some
  altercation, in which her load was left upon the ground, she kneeled
  upon her bundle of sticks, and raising her arms to Heaven, beneath the
  bright moon then at the full, spoke to the farmer, already shivering
  with cold, 'Heaven grant that thou mayest never know again the
  blessing to be warm.' He complained of cold all the next day, and wore
  an upper coat, and in a few days another, and in a fortnight took to
  his bed, always saying nothing made him warm; he covered himself with
  many blankets, and had a sieve over his face as he lay; and from this
  one insane idea he kept his bed above twenty years for fear of the
  cold air, till at length he died."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the "Advertisement" to the first edition of "Lyrical Ballads,"
Wordsworth says, </span>

<blockquote>"The tale of 'Goody Blake and Harry Gill' is founded on
a well-authenticated fact which happened in Warwickshire."</blockquote>

The following curious letter appeared in the <i>Ipswich Magazine</i> of April
1799:

  <blockquote>"<b>Ipswich</b>, April 2, 1799.<br>
<br>
  "To the Editors of the <i>Ipswich Magazine</i>.<br>
<br>
  "<b>Gentlemen</b>&mdash;The scarcity of Coal at this time, and the piercing cold
  of the weather, cannot fail to be some apology for the depredations
  daily committed on the hedges in the neighbourhood. If ever it be
  permitted, it ought in the present season. Should there be any Farmer
  more rigorous than the rest, let him attend to the poetical story
  inserted in page 118 of this Magazine, and tremble at the fate of
  Farmer Gill, who was about to prosecute a poor old woman for a similar
  offence. The thing is a fact, and told by one of the first physicians
  of the present day, as having happened in the south of England, 'and
  which has, a short time since', been turned by a <i>lyric poet</i> into
  that excellent ballad."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">From 1815 to 1843, this poem was classed among those of "the
Imagination." In 1845 it was transferred to the list of "Miscellaneous
Poems."&mdash;Ed.

<td>Oh! what's the matter? what's the matter?<br>
What is't that ails young Harry Gill?<br>
That evermore his teeth they chatter,<br>
Chatter, chatter, chatter still!<br>
Of waistcoats Harry has no lack,<br>
Good duffle grey, and flannel fine;<br>
He has a blanket on his back,<br>
And coats enough to smother nine.<br><br>

In March, December, and in July,<br>
'Tis all the same with Harry Gill;<br>
The neighbours tell, and tell you truly,<br>
His teeth they chatter, chatter still.<br>
At night, at morning, and at noon,<br>
'Tis all the same with Harry Gill;<br>
Beneath the sun, beneath the moon,<br>
His teeth they chatter, chatter still!<br><br>

Young Harry was a lusty drover,<br>
And who so stout of limb as he?<br>
His cheeks were red as ruddy clover;<br>
His voice was like the voice of three.<br>
Old Goody Blake was old and poor;<br>
Ill fed she was, and thinly clad;<br>
And any man who passed her door<br>
Might see how poor a hut she had.<br><br>

All day she spun in her poor dwelling:<br>
And then her three hours' work at night,<br>
Alas! 'twas hardly worth the telling,<br>
It would not pay for candle-light.<br>
Remote from sheltered village-green,<br>
On a hill's northern side she dwelt,<br>
Where from sea-blasts the hawthorns lean,<br>
And hoary dews are slow to melt.<br><br>

By the same fire to boil their pottage,<br>
Two poor old Dames, as I have known,<br>
Will often live in one small cottage;<br>
But she, poor Woman! housed alone.<br>
'Twas well enough when summer came,<br>
The long, warm, lightsome summer-day,<br>
Then at her door the <i>canty</i> Dame<br>
Would sit, as any linnet, gay.<br><br>

But when the ice our streams did fetter,<br>
Oh then how her old bones would shake;<br>
You would have said, if you had met her,<br>
'Twas a hard time for Goody Blake.<br>
Her evenings then were dull and dead:<br>
Sad case it was, as you may think,<br>
For very cold to go to bed;<br>
And then for cold not sleep a wink.<br><br>

O joy for her! whene'er in winter<br>
The winds at night had made a rout;<br>
And scattered many a lusty splinter<br>
And many a rotten bough about.<br>
Yet never had she, well or sick,<br>
As every man who knew her says,<br>
A pile beforehand, turf or stick,<br>
Enough to warm her for three days.<br><br>

Now, when the frost was past enduring,<br>
And made her poor old bones to ache,<br>
Could anything be more alluring<br>
Than an old hedge to Goody Blake?<br>
And, now and then, it must be said,<br>
When her old bones were cold and chill,<br>
She left her fire, or left her bed,<br>
To seek the hedge of Harry Gill.<br><br>

Now Harry he had long suspected<br>
This trespass of old Goody Blake;<br>
And vowed that she should be detected&mdash;<br>
That he on her would vengeance take.<br>
And oft from his warm fire he'd go,<br>
And to the fields his road would take;<br>
And there, at night, in frost and snow,<br>
He watched to seize old Goody Blake.<br><br>

And once, behind a rick of barley,<br>
Thus looking out did Harry stand:<br>
The moon was full and shining clearly,<br>
And crisp with frost the stubble land.<br>
&mdash;He hears a noise&mdash;he's all awake&mdash;<br>
Again?&mdash;on tip-toe down the hill<br>
He softly creeps&mdash;'tis Goody Blake;<br>
She's at the hedge of Harry Gill!<br><br>

Right glad was he when he beheld her:<br>
Stick after stick did Goody pull:<br>
He stood behind a bush of elder,<br>
Till she had filled her apron full.<br>
When with her load she turned about,<br>
The by-way back again to take;<br>
He started forward, with a shout,<br>
And sprang upon poor Goody Blake.<br><br>

And fiercely by the arm he took her,<br>
And by the arm he held her fast,<br>
And fiercely by the arm he shook her,<br>
And cried, "I've caught you then at last!"<br>
Then Goody, who had nothing said,<br>
Her bundle from her lap let fall;<br>
And, kneeling on the sticks, she prayed<br>
To God that is the judge of all.<br><br>

She prayed, her withered hand uprearing,<br>
While Harry held her by the arm&mdash;<br>
"God! who art never out of hearing,<br>
O may he never more be warm!"<br>
The cold, cold moon above her head,<br>
Thus on her knees did Goody pray;<br>
Young Harry heard what she had said:<br>
And icy cold he turned away.<br><br>
<br>
He went complaining all the morrow<br>
That he was cold and very chill:<br>
His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow,<br>
Alas! that day for Harry Gill!<br>
That day he wore a riding-coat,<br>
But not a whit the warmer he:<br>
Another was on Thursday brought,<br>
And ere the Sabbath he had three.<br><br>

'Twas all in vain, a useless matter,<br>
And blankets were about him pinned;<br>
Yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter,<br>
Like a loose casement in the wind.<br>
And Harry's flesh it fell away;<br>
And all who see him say, 'tis plain<br>
That, live as long as live he may,<br>
He never will be warm again.<br><br>

No word to any man he utters,<br>
A-bed or up, to young or old;<br>
But ever to himself he mutters,<br>
"Poor Harry Gill is very cold."<br>
A-bed or up, by night or day;<br>
His teeth they chatter, chatter still.<br>
Now think, ye farmers all, I pray,<br>
Of Goody Blake and Harry Gill!</td>

<h2><a name="section19">Simon Lee, the Old Huntsman</a></h2>
	<i><b>with an incident in which he was concerned.</b></i><br>
	<br>
	<h4>Composed 1798.&mdash;Published 1798.</h4>

	<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">This old man had been huntsman to the Squires of Alfoxden, which, at
  the time we occupied it, belonged to a minor. The old man's cottage
  stood upon the Common, a little way from the entrance to Alfoxden
  Park. But it had disappeared. Many other changes had taken place in
  the adjoining village, which I could not but notice with a regret more
  natural than well-considered. Improvements but rarely appear such to
  those who, after long intervals of time, revisit places they have had
  much pleasure in. It is unnecessary to add, the fact was as mentioned
  in the poem; and I have, after an interval of forty-five years, the
  image of the old man as fresh before my eyes as if I had seen him
  yesterday. The expression when the hounds were out, 'I dearly love
  their voice,' was word for word from his own lips.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote>

<td>In the sweet shire of Cardigan,<br>
Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall,<br>
An old Man dwells, a little man,&mdash;<br>
'Tis said he once was tall.<br>
Full five-and-thirty years he lived<br>
A running huntsman merry;<br>
And still the centre of his cheek<br>
Is red as a ripe cherry.<br><br>

No man like him the horn could sound,<br>
And hill and valley rang with glee:<br>
When Echo bandied, round and round,<br>
The halloo of Simon Lee.<br>
In those proud days, he little cared<br>
For husbandry or tillage;<br>
To blither tasks did Simon rouse<br>
The sleepers of the village.<br><br>

He all the country could outrun,<br>
Could leave both man and horse behind;<br>
And often, ere the chase was done,<br>
He reeled, and was stone blind.<br>
And still there's something in the world<br>
At which his heart rejoices;<br>
For when the chiming hounds are out,<br>
He dearly loves their voices!<br><br>

But, oh the heavy change!&mdash;bereft<br>
Of health, strength, friends, and kindred, see!<br>
Old Simon to the world is left<br>
In liveried poverty.<br>
His Master's dead,&mdash;and no one now<br>
Dwells in the Hall of Ivor;<br>
Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead;<br>
He is the sole survivor.<br><br>

And he is lean and he is sick;<br>
His body, dwindled and awry,<br>
Rests upon ankles swoln and thick;<br>
His legs are thin and dry.<br>
One prop he has, and only one,<br>
His wife, an aged woman,<br>
Lives with him, near the waterfall,<br>
Upon the village Common.<br><br>

Beside their moss-grown hut of clay,<br>
Not twenty paces from the door,<br>
A scrap of land they have, but they<br>
Are poorest of the poor.<br>
This scrap of land he from the heath<br>
Enclosed when he was stronger;<br>
But what to them avails the land<br>
Which he can till no longer?<br><br>

Oft, working by her Husband's side,<br>
Ruth does what Simon cannot do;<br>
For she, with scanty cause for pride,<br>
Is stouter of the two.<br>
And, though you with your utmost skill<br>
From labour could not wean them,<br>
'Tis little, very little&mdash;all<br>
That they can do between them.<br><br>

Few months of life has he in store<br>
As he to you will tell,<br>
For still, the more he works, the more<br>
Do his weak ankles swell.<br>
My gentle Reader, I perceive<br>
How patiently you've waited,<br>
And now I fear that you expect<br>
Some tale will be related.<br><br>

O Reader! had you in your mind<br>
Such stores as silent thought can bring,<br>
O gentle Reader! you would find<br>
A tale in every thing.<br>
What more I have to say is short,<br>
And you must kindly take it:<br>
It is no tale; but, should you think,<br>
Perhaps a tale you'll make it.<br><br>

One summer-day I chanced to see<br>
This old Man doing all he could<br>
To unearth the root of an old tree,<br>
A stump of rotten wood.<br>
The mattock tottered in his hand;<br>
So vain was his endeavour,<br>
That at the root of the old tree<br>
He might have worked for ever.<br><br>

"You're overtasked, good Simon Lee,<br>
Give me your tool," to him I said;<br>
And at the word right gladly he<br>
Received my proffered aid.<br>
I struck, and with a single blow<br>
The tangled root I severed,<br>
At which the poor old Man so long<br>
And vainly had endeavoured.<br><br>

The tears into his eyes were brought,<br>
And thanks and praises seemed to run<br>
So fast out of his heart, I thought<br>
They never would have done.<br>
&mdash;I've heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds<br>
With coldness still returning;<br>
Alas! the gratitude of men<br>
Hath oftener left me mourning.</td>

<h4>Composed 1798.&mdash;Published 1798.</h4>

<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">Actually composed while I was sitting by the side of the brook that
  runs down from the <i>Comb</i>, in which stands the village of Alford,
  through the grounds of Alfoxden. It was a chosen resort of mine. The
  brook ran down a sloping rock, so as to make a waterfall, considerable
  for that county; and across the pool below had fallen a tree&mdash;an ash
  if I rightly remember&mdash;from which rose perpendicularly, boughs in
  search of the light intercepted by the deep shade above. The boughs
  bore leaves of green, that for want of sunshine had faded into almost
  lily-white; and from the underside of this natural sylvan bridge
  depended long and beautiful tresses of ivy, which waved gently in the
  breeze, that might, poetically speaking, be called the breath of the
  waterfall. This motion varied of course in proportion to the power of
  water in the brook. <a name="fr20A">When</a>, with dear friends, I revisited this spot,
  after an interval of more than forty years<a href="#20A"><sup>A</sup></a>, this interesting
  feature of the scene was gone. To the owner of the place I could not
  but regret that the beauty of this retired part of the grounds had not
  tempted him to make it more accessible by a path, not broad or
  obtrusive, but sufficient for persons who love such scenes to creep
  along without difficulty.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote>

While in a grove I sate reclined,<br>
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts<br>
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.<br><br>

And much it grieved my heart to think<br>

The periwinkle trailed its wreaths; <br>

Their thoughts I cannot measure:&mdash;<br>
But the least motion which they made,<br>
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.<br><br>

The budding twigs spread out their fan,<br>
To catch the breezy air;<br>
And I must think, do all I can,<br>
That there was pleasure there. <br><br>

If this belief from heaven be sent,<br>
If such be Nature's holy plan,<br>
Have I not reason to lament<br>

<span style="color: #555555;">This Alfoxden dell, once known locally as "The Mare's Pool," was a
trysting-place of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and their friends. Coleridge
thus describes it, in his poem beginning "This Lime-Tree Bower, my
Prison," addressed to Charles Lamb:</span>

  <blockquote>The roaring dell, o'er-wooded, narrow, deep,<br>
  And only speckled by the midday sun;<br>
  Where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock<br>
  Flings arching like a bridge;&mdash;that branchless ash,<br>
  Unsunn'd and damp, whose few poor yellow leaves<br>
  Ne'er tremble in the gale, yet tremble still,<br>
  Fanned by the waterfall!</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Of all the localities around Alfoxden, this grove is the one chiefly
associated with Wordsworth. There was no path to the waterfall, as
suggested by the Poet to the owner of the place, in 1840; but, in 1880,
I found the "natural sylvan bridge" restored. An ash tree, having fallen
across the glen, reproduced the scene exactly as it is described in the
Fenwick note.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<h2><a name="section21">To my Sister</a></h2>

<h4>Composed 1798.&mdash;Published 1798.</h4>

  <blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">Composed in front of Alfoxden House. My little boy-messenger on this
  occasion was the son of Basil Montagu. The larch mentioned in the
  first stanza was standing when I revisited the place in May 1841, more
  than forty years after. I was disappointed that it had not improved in
  appearance as to size, nor had it acquired anything of the majesty of
  age, which, even though less perhaps than any other tree, the larch
  sometimes does. A few score yards from this tree, grew, when we
  inhabited Alfoxden, one of the most remarkable beech-trees ever seen.
  The ground sloped both towards and from it. It was of immense size,
  and threw out arms that struck into the soil, like those of the
  banyan-tree, and rose again from it. Two of the branches thus inserted
  themselves twice, which gave to each the appearance of a serpent
  moving along by gathering itself up in folds. One of the large boughs
  of this tree had been torn off by the wind before we left Alfoxden,
  but five remained. In 1841 we could barely find the spot where the
  tree had stood. So remarkable a production of nature could not have
  been wilfully destroyed.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the editions 1798 to 1815 the title of this poem was, <i>Lines written
at a small distance from my House, and sent by my little Boy to the
person to whom they are addressed</i>. From 1820 to 1843 the title was, <i>To
my Sister; written at a small distance from my House, and sent by my
little Boy</i>. In 1845 and afterwards, it was simply <i>To my Sister</i>. The
poem was placed by Wordsworth among those of "Sentiment and
Reflection."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<h2><a name="section24">The Complaint of a Forsaken Indian Woman</a></h2>

<h4>Composed 1798.&mdash;Published 1798.</h4>

When a Northern Indian, from sickness, is unable to continue his journey
with his companions; he is left behind, covered over with Deer-skins,
and is supplied with water, food, and fuel if the situation of the place
will afford it. He is informed of the track which his companions intend
to pursue, and if he is unable to follow, or overtake them, he perishes
alone in the Desart; unless he should have the good fortune to fall in
with some other Tribes of Indians. It is unnecessary to add that the
females are equally, or still more, exposed to the same fate. See that
very interesting work, Hearne's 'Journey from Hudson's Bay to the
Northern Ocean'. When the Northern Lights, as the same writer informs
us, vary their position in the air, they make a rustling and a crackling
noise. This circumstance is alluded to in the first stanza of the
following poem.&mdash;W. W. 1798.

  <blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">At Alfoxden, in 1798, where I read Hearne's 'Journey' with deep
  interest. It was composed for the volume of "Lyrical Ballads."&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote>

<h2><a name="section26">The Idiot Boy</a></h2>

<h4>Composed 1798.&mdash;Published 1798.</h4>

<blockquote><span style="color: #663300;">Alfoxden, 1798. The last stanza, 'The cocks did crow to-whoo,
  to-whoo, and the sun did shine so cold,' was the foundation of the
  whole. The words were reported to me by my dear friend Thomas Poole;
  but I have since heard the same repeated of other idiots. Let me add,
  that this long poem was composed in the groves of Alfoxden, almost
  extempore; not a word, I believe, being corrected, though one stanza
  was omitted. I mention this in gratitude to those happy moments, for,
  in truth, I never wrote anything with so much glee.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote>

<td>'Tis eight o'clock,&mdash;a clear March night,<br>
The moon is up,&mdash;the sky is blue,<br>
The owlet, in the moonlight air,<br>
Shouts from nobody knows where;<br>
He lengthens out his lonely shout,<br>
Halloo! halloo! a long halloo!<br><br>

&mdash;Why bustle thus about your door,<br>
What means this bustle, Betty Foy?<br>
Why are you in this mighty fret?<br>
And why on horseback have you set<br>
Him whom you love, your Idiot Boy?<br>
<br>
Scarcely a soul is out of bed:<br>
Good Betty, put him down again;<br>
His lips with joy they burr at you;<br>
But, Betty! what has he to do<br>
With stirrup, saddle, or with rein?<br>
<br>
But Betty's bent on her intent;<br>
For her good neighbour, Susan Gale,<br>
Old Susan, she who dwells alone,<br>
Is sick, and makes a piteous moan,<br>
As if her very life would fail.<br><br>

There's not a house within a mile,<br>
No hand to help them in distress;<br>
Old Susan lies a-bed in pain,<br>
And sorely puzzled are the twain,<br>
For what she ails they cannot guess.<br><br>

And Betty's husband's at the wood,<br>
Where by the week he doth abide,<br>
A woodman in the distant vale;<br>
There's none to help poor Susan Gale;<br>
What must be done? what will betide?<br><br>

And Betty from the lane has fetched<br>
Her Pony, that is mild and good;<br>
Whether he be in joy or pain,<br>
Feeding at will along the lane,<br>
Or bringing faggots from the wood.<br><br>

And he is all in travelling trim,&mdash;<br>
And, by the moonlight, Betty Foy<br>
Has on the well-girt saddle set<br>
(The like was never heard of yet)<br>
Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy.<br><br>

And he must post without delay<br>
Across the bridge and through the dale,<br>
And by the church, and o'er the down,<br>
To bring a Doctor from the town,<br>
Or she will die, old Susan Gale.<br><br>

There is no need of boot or spur,<br>
There is no need of whip or wand;<br>
For Johnny has his holly-bough,<br>
And with a <i>hurly-burly</i> now<br>
He shakes the green bough in his hand.<br><br>

And Betty o'er and o'er has told<br>
The Boy, who is her best delight,<br>
Both what to follow, what to shun,<br>
What do, and what to leave undone,<br>
How turn to left, and how to right.<br><br>

And Betty's most especial charge,<br>
Was, "Johnny! Johnny! mind that you<br>
Come home again, nor stop at all,&mdash;<br>
Come home again, whate'er befal,<br>
My Johnny, do, I pray you do."<br><br>

To this did Johnny answer make,<br>
Both with his head and with his hand,<br>
And proudly shook the bridle too;<br>
And then! his words were not a few,<br>
Which Betty well could understand.<br><br>

And now that Johnny is just going,<br>
Though Betty's in a mighty flurry,<br>
She gently pats the Pony's side,<br>
On which her Idiot Boy must ride,<br>
And seems no longer in a hurry.<br><br>

But when the Pony moved his legs,<br>
Oh! then for the poor Idiot Boy!<br>
For joy he cannot hold the bridle,<br>
For joy his head and heels are idle,<br>
He's idle all for very joy.<br><br>

And while the Pony moves his legs,<br>
In Johnny's left hand you may see<br>
The green bough motionless and dead:<br>
The Moon that shines above his head<br>
Is not more still and mute than he.<br><br>

His heart it was so full of glee,<br>
That till full fifty yards were gone,<br>
He quite forgot his holly whip,<br>
And all his skill in horsemanship:<br>
Oh! happy, happy, happy John.<br><br>

And while the Mother, at the door,<br>
Stands fixed, her face with joy o'erflows<br>
Proud of herself, and proud of him,<br>
She sees him in his travelling trim,<br>
How quietly her Johnny goes.<br><br>

The silence of her Idiot Boy,<br>
What hopes it sends to Betty's heart!<br>
He's at the guide-post&mdash;he turns right;<br>
She watches till he's out of sight,<br>
And Betty will not then depart.<br><br>

Burr, burr&mdash;now Johnny's lips they burr.<br>
As loud as any mill, or near it;<br>
Meek as a lamb the Pony moves,<br>
And Johnny makes the noise he loves,<br>
And Betty listens, glad to hear it.<br><br>

Away she hies to Susan Gale:<br>
Her Messenger's in merry tune;<br>
The owlets hoot, the owlets curr,<br>
And Johnny's lips they burr, burr, burr,<br>
As on he goes beneath the moon.<br><br>

His steed and he right well agree;<br>
For of this Pony there's a rumour,<br>
That, should he lose his eyes and ears,<br>
And should he live a thousand years,<br>
He never will be out of humour.<br><br>

But then he is a horse that thinks!<br>
And when he thinks, his pace is slack;<br>
Now, though he knows poor Johnny well,<br>
Yet, for his life, he cannot tell<br>
What he has got upon his back.<br><br>

So through the moonlight lanes they go,<br>
And far into the moonlight dale,<br>
And by the church, and o'er the down,<br>
To bring a Doctor from the town,<br>
To comfort poor old Susan Gale.<br><br>

And Betty, now at Susan's side,<br>
Is in the middle of her story,<br>
What speedy help her Boy will bring,<br>
With many a most diverting thing,<br>
Of Johnny's wit, and Johnny's glory.<br><br>

And Betty, still at Susan's side,<br>
By this time is not quite so flurried:<br>
Demure with porringer and plate<br>
She sits, as if in Susan's fate<br>
Her life and soul were buried.<br><br>

But Betty, poor good woman! she,<br>
You plainly in her face may read it,<br>
Could lend out of that moment's store<br>
Five years of happiness or more<br>
To any that might need it.<br><br>

But yet I guess that now and then<br>
With Betty all was not so well;<br>
And to the road she turns her ears,<br>
And thence full many a sound she hears,<br>
Which she to Susan will not tell.<br><br>

Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans;<br>
"As sure as there's a moon in heaven,"<br>
Cries Betty, "he'll be back again;<br>
They'll both be here&mdash;'tis almost ten&mdash;<br>
Both will be here before eleven."<br><br>

Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans;<br>
The clock gives warning for eleven;<br>
'Tis on the stroke&mdash;"He must be near,"<br>
Quoth Betty, "and will soon be here,<br>
As sure as there's a moon in heaven."<br><br>

The clock is on the stroke of twelve,<br>
And Johnny is not yet in sight:<br>
&mdash;The Moon's in heaven, as Betty sees,<br>
But Betty is not quite at ease;<br>
And Susan has a dreadful night.<br><br>

And Betty, half an hour ago,<br>
On Johnny vile reflections cast:<br>
"A little idle sauntering Thing!"<br>
With other names, an endless string;<br>
But now that time is gone and past.<br><br>

And Betty's drooping at the heart,<br>
That happy time all past and gone,<br>
"How can it be he is so late?<br>
The Doctor, he has made him wait;<br>
Susan! they'll both be here anon."<br><br>

And Susan's growing worse and worse,<br>
And Betty's in a sad <i>quandary</i>;<br>
And then there's nobody to say<br>
If she must go, or she must stay!<br>
&mdash;She's in a sad <i>quandary</i>.<br><br>

The clock is on the stroke of one;<br>
But neither Doctor nor his Guide<br>
Appears along the moonlight road;<br>
There's neither horse nor man abroad,<br>
And Betty's still at Susan's side.<br><br>

And Susan now begins to fear<br>
Of sad mischances not a few,<br>
That Johnny may perhaps be drowned;<br>
Or lost, perhaps, and never found;<br>
Which they must both for ever rue.<br><br>

She prefaced half a hint of this<br>
With, "God forbid it should be true!"<br>
At the first word that Susan said<br>
Cried Betty, rising from the bed,<br>
"Susan, I'd gladly stay with you.<br><br>

"I must be gone, I must away:<br>
Consider, Johnny's but half-wise;<br>
Susan, we must take care of him,<br>
If he is hurt in life or limb"&mdash;<br>
"Oh God forbid!" poor Susan cries.<br><br>

"What can I do?" says Betty, going,<br>
"What can I do to ease your pain?<br>
Good Susan tell me, and I'll stay;<br>
I fear you're in a dreadful way,<br>
But I shall soon be back again."<br><br>

"Nay, Betty, go! good Betty, go!<br>
There's nothing that can ease my pain."<br>
Then off she hies; but with a prayer<br>
That God poor Susan's life would spare,<br>
Till she comes back again.<br><br>

So, through the moonlight lane she goes,<br>
And far into the moonlight dale;<br>
And how she ran, and how she walked,<br>
And all that to herself she talked,<br>
Would surely be a tedious tale.<br><br>

In high and low, above, below,<br>
In great and small, in round and square,<br>
In tree and tower was Johnny seen,<br>
In bush and brake, in black and green;<br>
'Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where.<br><br>

And while she crossed the bridge, there came<br>
A thought with which her heart is sore&mdash;<br>
Johnny perhaps his horse forsook,<br>
To hunt the moon within the brook,<br>
And never will be heard of more.<br><br>

Now is she high upon the down,<br>
Alone amid a prospect wide;<br>
There's neither Johnny nor his Horse<br>
Among the fern or in the gorse;<br>
There's neither Doctor nor his Guide.<br><br>

"Oh saints! what is become of him?<br>
Perhaps he's climbed into an oak,<br>
Where he will stay till he is dead;<br>
Or, sadly he has been misled,<br>
And joined the wandering gipsy-folk.<br><br>

"Or him that wicked Pony's carried<br>
To the dark cave, the goblin's hall;<br>
Or in the castle he's pursuing<br>
Among the ghosts his own undoing;<br>
Or playing with the waterfall."<br><br>

At poor old Susan then she railed,<br>
While to the town she posts away;<br>
"If Susan had not been so ill,<br>
Alas! I should have had him still,<br>
My Johnny, till my dying day."<br><br>

Poor Betty, in this sad distemper,<br>
The Doctor's self could hardly spare:<br>
Unworthy things she talked, and wild;<br>
Even he, of cattle the most mild,<br>
The Pony had his share.<br><br>

But now she's fairly in the town,<br>
And to the Doctor's door she hies;<br>
'Tis silence all on every side;<br>
The town so long, the town so wide,<br>
Is silent as the skies.<br><br>

And now she's at the Doctor's door,<br>
She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap;<br>
The Doctor at the casement shows<br>
His glimmering eyes that peep and doze!<br>
And one hand rubs his old night-cap.<br><br>

"Oh Doctor! Doctor! where's my Johnny?"<br>
"I'm here, what is't you want with me?"<br>
"Oh Sir! you know I'm Betty Foy,<br>
And I have lost my poor dear Boy,<br>
You know him&mdash;him you often see;<br><br>

"He's not so wise as some folks be":<br>
"The devil take his wisdom!" said<br>
The Doctor, looking somewhat grim,<br>
"What, Woman! should I know of him?"<br>
And, grumbling, he went back to bed!<br><br>

"O woe is me! O woe is me!<br>
Here will I die; here will I die;<br>
I thought to find my lost one here,<br>
But he is neither far nor near,<br>
Oh! what a wretched Mother I!"<br><br>

She stops, she stands, she looks about;<br>
Which way to turn she cannot tell.<br>
Poor Betty! it would ease her pain<br>
If she had heart to knock again;<br>
&mdash;The clock strikes three&mdash;a dismal knell!<br><br>

Then up along the town she hies,<br>
No wonder if her senses fail;<br>
This piteous news so much it shocked her,<br>
She quite forgot to send the Doctor,<br>
To comfort poor old Susan Gale.<br><br>

And now she's high upon the down,<br>
And she can see a mile of road:<br>
"O cruel! I'm almost threescore;<br>
Such night as this was ne'er before,<br>
There's not a single soul abroad."<br><br>

She listens, but she cannot hear<br>
The foot of horse, the voice of man;<br>
The streams with softest sound are flowing,<br>
The grass you almost hear it growing,<br>
You hear it now, if e'er you can.<br><br>

The owlets through the long blue night<br>
Are shouting to each other still:<br>
Fond lovers! yet not quite hob nob,<br>
They lengthen out the tremulous sob,<br>
That echoes far from hill to hill.<br><br>

Poor Betty now has lost all hope,<br>
Her thoughts are bent on deadly sin,<br>
A green-grown pond she just has past,<br>
And from the brink she hurries fast,<br>
Lest she should drown herself therein.<br><br>

And now she sits her down and weeps;<br>
Such tears she never shed before;<br>
"Oh dear, dear Pony! my sweet joy!<br>
Oh carry back my Idiot Boy!<br>
And we will ne'er o'erload thee more."<br><br>

A thought is come into her head:<br>
The Pony he is mild and good,<br>
And we have always used him well;<br>
Perhaps he's gone along the dell,<br>
And carried Johnny to the wood.<br><br>

Then up she springs as if on wings;<br>
She thinks no more of deadly sin;<br>
If Betty fifty ponds should see,<br>
The last of all her thoughts would be<br>
To drown herself therein.<br><br>

O Reader! now that I might tell<br>
What Johnny and his Horse are doing!<br>
What they've been doing all this time,<br>
Oh could I put it into rhyme,<br>
A most delightful tale pursuing!<br><br>

Perhaps, and no unlikely thought!<br>
He with his Pony now doth roam<br>
The cliffs and peaks so high that are,<br>
To lay his hands upon a star,<br>
And in his pocket bring it home.<br><br>

Perhaps he's turned himself about,<br>
His face unto his horse's tail,<br>
And, still and mute, in wonder lost,<br>
All silent as a horseman-ghost,<br>
He travels slowly down the vale.<br><br>

And now, perhaps, is hunting sheep,<br>
A fierce and dreadful hunter he;<br>
Yon valley, now so trim and green,<br>
In five months' time, should he be seen,<br>
A desert wilderness will be!<br><br>

Perhaps, with head and heels on fire,<br>
And like the very soul of evil,<br>
He's galloping away, away,<br>
And so will gallop on for aye,<br>
The bane of all that dread the devil!<br><br>

I to the Muses have been bound<br>
These fourteen years, by strong indentures:<br>
O gentle Muses! let me tell<br>
But half of what to him befel;<br>
He surely met with strange adventures.<br><br>

O gentle Muses! is this kind?<br>
Why will ye thus my suit repel?<br>
Why of your further aid bereave me?<br>
And can ye thus unfriended leave me;<br>
Ye Muses! whom I love so well?<br><br>

Who's yon, that, near the waterfall,<br>
Which thunders down with headlong force<br>
Beneath the moon, yet shining fair,<br>
As careless as if nothing were,<br>
Sits upright on a feeding horse?<br><br>

Unto his horse&mdash;there feeding free,<br>
He seems, I think, the rein to give;<br>
Of moon or stars he takes no heed;<br>
Of such we in romances read:<br>
&mdash;'Tis Johnny! Johnny! as I live.<br><br>

And that's the very Pony, too!<br>
Where is she, where is Betty Foy?<br>
She hardly can sustain her fears;<br>
The roaring waterfall she hears,<br>
And cannot find her Idiot Boy.<br><br>

Your Pony's worth his weight in gold:<br>
Then calm your terrors, Betty Foy!<br>
She's coming from among the trees,<br>
And now all full in view she sees<br>
Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy.<br><br>

And Betty sees the Pony too:<br>
Why stand you thus, good Betty Foy?<br>
It is no goblin, 'tis no ghost,<br>
'Tis he whom you so long have lost,<br>
He whom you love, your Idiot Boy.<br><br>

She looks again&mdash;her arms are up&mdash;<br>
She screams&mdash;she cannot move for joy;<br>
She darts, as with a torrent's force,<br>
She almost has o'erturned the Horse,<br>
And fast she holds her Idiot Boy.<br><br>

And Johnny burrs, and laughs aloud;<br>
Whether in cunning or in joy<br>
I cannot tell; but while he laughs,<br>
Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs<br>
To hear again her Idiot Boy.<br><br>

And now she's at the Pony's tail,<br>
And now is at the Pony's head,&mdash;<br>
On that side now, and now on this;<br>
And, almost stifled with her bliss,<br>
A few sad tears does Betty shed.<br><br>

She kisses o'er and o'er again<br>
Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy;<br>
She's happy here, is happy there,<br>
She is uneasy every where;<br>
Her limbs are all alive with joy.<br><br>

She pats the Pony, where or when<br>
She knows not, happy Betty Foy!<br>
The little Pony glad may be,<br>
But he is milder far than she,<br>
You hardly can perceive his joy.<br><br>

"Oh! Johnny, never mind the Doctor;<br>
You've done your best, and that is all:"<br>
She took the reins, when this was said,<br>
And gently turned the Pony's head<br>
From the loud waterfall.<br><br>

By this the stars were almost gone,<br>
The moon was setting on the hill,<br>
So pale you scarcely looked at her:<br>
The little birds began to stir,<br>
Though yet their tongues were still.<br><br>

The Pony, Betty, and her Boy,<br>
Wind slowly through the woody dale;<br>
And who is she, betimes abroad,<br>
That hobbles up the steep rough road?<br>
Who is it, but old Susan Gale?<br><br>

Long time lay Susan lost in thought;<br>
And many dreadful fears beset her,<br>
Both for her Messenger and Nurse;<br>
And, as her mind grew worse and worse,<br>
Her body&mdash;it grew better.<br><br>

She turned, she tossed herself in bed,<br>
On all sides doubts and terrors met her;<br>
Point after point did she discuss;<br>
And, while her mind was fighting thus,<br>
Her body still grew better.<br><br>

"Alas! what is become of them?<br>
These fears can never be endured;<br>
I'll to the wood."&mdash;The word scarce said,<br>
Did Susan rise up from her bed,<br>
As if by magic cured.<br><br>

Away she goes up hill and down,<br>
And to the wood at length is come;<br>
She spies her Friends, she shouts a greeting;<br>
Oh me! it is a merry meeting<br>
As ever was in Christendom.<br><br>

The owls have hardly sung their last,<br>
While our four travellers homeward wend;<br>
The owls have hooted all night long,<br>
And with the owls began my song,<br>
And with the owls must end.<br><br>

For while they all were travelling home,<br>
Cried Betty, "Tell us, Johnny, do,<br>
Where all this long night you have been,<br>
What you have heard, what you have seen:<br>
And, Johnny, mind you tell us true."<br><br>

Now Johnny all night long had heard<br>
The owls in tuneful concert strive;<br>
No doubt too he the moon had seen;<br>
For in the moonlight he had been <br>
From eight o'clock till five.<br><br>

And thus, to Betty's question, he<br>
Made answer, like a traveller bold,<br>
(His very words I give to you,)<br>
"The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo,<br>
And the sun did shine so cold!"<br>
&mdash;Thus answered Johnny in his glory,<br>
And that was all his travel's story.</td>

<h2><a name="section27"></a>The Old Cumberland Beggar<a href="#27A"><span style="font-size: 70%;"><sup>A</sup></span></a></h2>

<h4>Composed 1798.&mdash;Published 1800.</h4>

The class of Beggars to which the old man here described
belongs, will probably soon be extinct. It consisted of poor,
and, mostly, old and infirm persons, who confined themselves to
a stated round in their neighbourhood, and had certain fixed
days, on which, at different houses, they regularly received
charity; sometimes in money, but mostly in provisions.-W. W.
1800.

 <blockquote><span style="color: #663300;"> Observed, and with great benefit to my own heart, when I was a child.
  <a name="fr27B">Written</a> at Racedown and Alfoxden in my twenty-third year<a href="#27B"><sup>B</sup></a>. The
  Political Economists were about that time beginning their war upon
  mendicity in all its forms, and by implication, if not directly, on
  alms-giving also. This heartless process has been carried as far as it
  can go by the <b>Amended</b> Poor Law Bill, tho' the inhumanity that prevails
  in this measure is somewhat disguised by the profession that one of
  its objects is to throw the poor upon the voluntary donations of their
  neighbours; that is, if rightly interpreted, to force them into a
  condition between relief in the Union Poor House and alms robbed of
  their Christian grace and spirit, as being <i>forced</i> rather from the
  benevolent than given by them; while the avaricious and selfish, and
  all, in fact, but the humane and charitable, are at liberty to keep
  all they possess from their distressed brethren.&mdash;I. F.</span></blockquote>

<td>I saw an aged Beggar in my walk;<br>
And he was seated, by the highway side,<br>
On a low structure of rude masonry<br>
Built at the foot of a huge hill, that they<br>
Who lead their horses down the steep rough road<br>
May thence remount at ease. The aged Man<br>
Had placed his staff across the broad smooth stone<br>
That overlays the pile; and, from a bag<br>
All white with flour, the dole of village dames,<br>
He drew his scraps and fragments, one by one;<br>
And scanned them with a fixed and serious look<br>
Of idle computation. In the sun,<br>
Upon the second step of that small pile,<br>
Surrounded by those wild unpeopled hills,<br>
He sat, and ate his food in solitude:<br>
And ever, scattered from his palsied hand,<br>
That, still attempting to prevent the waste,<br>
Was baffled still, the crumbs in little showers<br>
Fell on the ground; and the small mountain birds,<br>
Not venturing yet to peck their destined meal,<br>
Approached within the length of half his staff.<br><br>

Him from my childhood have I known; and then<br>
He was so old, he seems not older now;<br>
He travels on, a solitary Man,<br>
So helpless in appearance, that for him<br>
The sauntering Horseman throws not with a slack<br>
And careless hand his alms upon the ground,<br>
But stops,&mdash;that he may safely lodge the coin<br>
Within the old Man's hat; nor quits him so,<br>
But still, when he has given his horse the rein,<br>
Watches the aged Beggar with a look<br>
Sidelong, and half-reverted. She who tends<br>
The toll-gate, when in summer at her door<br>
She turns her wheel, if on the road she sees<br>
The aged beggar coming, quits her work,<br>
And lifts the latch for him that he may pass.<br>
The post-boy, when his rattling wheels o'ertake<br>
The aged Beggar in the woody lane,<br>
Shouts to him from behind; and, if thus warned<br>
The old man does not change his course, the boy<br>
Turns with less noisy wheels to the roadside,<br>
And passes gently by, without a curse<br>
Upon his lips, or anger at his heart.<br><br>

He travels on, a solitary Man;<br>
His age has no companion. On the ground<br>
His eyes are turned, and, as he moves along,<br>
_They_ move along the ground; and, evermore,<br>
Instead of common and habitual sight<br>
Of fields with rural works, of hill and dale,<br>
And the blue sky, one little span of earth<br>
Is all his prospect. Thus, from day to day,<br>
Bow-bent, his eyes for ever on the ground,<br>
He plies his weary journey; seeing still,<br>
And seldom knowing that he sees, some straw,<br>
Some scattered leaf, or marks which, in one track,<br>
The nails of cart or chariot-wheel have left<br>
Impressed on the white road,&mdash;in the same line,<br>
At distance still the same. Poor Traveller!<br>
His staff trails with him; scarcely do his feet<br>
Disturb the summer dust; he is so still<br>
In look and motion, that the cottage curs,<br>
Ere he has passed the door, will turn away,<br>
Weary of barking at him. Boys and girls,<br>
The vacant and the busy, maids and youths,<br>
And urchins newly breeched&mdash;all pass him by:<br>
Him even the slow-paced waggon leaves behind.<br><br>

But deem not this Man useless.&mdash;Statesmen! ye<br>
Who are so restless in your wisdom, ye<br>
Who have a broom still ready in your hands<br>
To rid the world of nuisances; ye proud,<br>
Heart-swoln, while in your pride ye contemplate<br>
Your talents, power, or wisdom, deem him not<br>
A burthen of the earth! 'Tis nature's law<br>
That none, the meanest of created things,<br>
Of forms created the most vile and brute,<br>
The dullest or most noxious, should exist<br>
Divorced from good&mdash;a spirit and pulse of good,<br>
A life and soul, to every mode of being<br>
Inseparably linked. Then be assured<br>
That least of all can aught&mdash;that ever owned<br>
The heaven-regarding eye and front sublime<br>
Which man is born to&mdash;sink, howe'er depressed,<br>
So low as to be scorned without a sin;<br>
Without offence to God cast out of view;<br>
Like the dry remnant of a garden-flower<br>
Whose seeds are shed, or as an implement<br>
Worn out and worthless. While from door to door<br>
This old Man creeps, the villagers in him<br>
Behold a record which together binds<br>
Past deeds and offices of charity,<br>
Else unremembered, and so keeps alive<br>
The kindly mood in hearts which lapse of years,<br>
And that half-wisdom half-experience gives,<br>
Make slow to feel, and by sure steps resign<br>
To selfishness and cold oblivious cares.<br>
Among the farms and solitary huts,<br>
Hamlets and thinly-scattered villages,<br>
Where'er the aged Beggar takes his rounds,<br>
The mild necessity of use compels<br>
To acts of love; and habit does the work<br>
Of reason; yet prepares that after-joy<br>
Which reason cherishes. And thus the soul,<br>
By that sweet taste of pleasure unpursued<br>
Doth find herself  insensibly disposed<br>
To virtue and true goodness.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                             Some there are,<br>
By their good works exalted, lofty minds<br>
And meditative, authors of delight<br>
And happiness, which to the end of time<br>
Will live, and spread, and kindle: even such minds<br>
In childhood, from this solitary Being,<br>
Or from like wanderer, haply have received<br>
(A thing more precious far than all that books<br>
Or the solicitudes of love can do!)<br>
That first mild touch of sympathy and thought,<br>
In which they found their kindred with a world<br>
Where want and sorrow were. The easy man<br>
Who sits at his own door,&mdash;and, like the pear<br>
That overhangs his head from the green wall,<br>
Feeds in the sunshine; the robust and young,<br>
The prosperous and unthinking, they who live<br>
Sheltered, and flourish in a little grove<br>
Of their own kindred;&mdash;all behold in him<br>
A silent monitor, which on their minds<br>
Must needs impress a transitory thought<br>
Of self-congratulation, to the heart<br>
Of each recalling his peculiar boons,<br>
His charters and exemptions; and, perchance,<br>
Though he to no one give the fortitude<br>
And circumspection needful to preserve<br>
His present blessings, and to husband up<br>
The respite of the season, he, at least,<br>
And 'tis no vulgar service, makes them felt.<br><br>

Yet further.&mdash;Many, I believe, there are<br>
Who live a life of virtuous decency,<br>
Men who can hear the Decalogue and feel<br>
No self-reproach; who of the moral law<br>
Established in the land where they abide<br>
Are strict observers; and not negligent<br>
In acts of love to those with whom they dwell,<br>
Their kindred, and the children of their blood.<br>
Praise be to such, and to their slumbers peace!<br>
&mdash;But of the poor man ask, the abject poor;<br>
Go, and demand of him, if there be here<br>
In this cold abstinence from evil deeds,<br>
And these inevitable charities,<br>
Wherewith to satisfy the human soul?<br>
No&mdash;man is dear to man; the poorest poor<br>
Long for some moments in a weary life<br>
When they can know and feel that they have been,<br>
Themselves, the fathers and the dealers-out<br>
Of some small blessings; have been kind to such<br>
As needed kindness, for this single cause,<br>
That we have all of us one human heart.<br>
&mdash;Such pleasure is to one kind Being known,<br>
My neighbour, when with punctual care, each week<br>
Duly as Friday comes, though pressed herself<br>
By her own wants, she from her store of meal<br>
Takes one unsparing handful for the scrip<br>
Of this old Mendicant, and, from her door<br>
Returning with exhilarated heart,<br>
Sits by her fire, and builds her hope in heaven.<br><br>

Then let him pass, a blessing on his head!<br>
And while in that vast solitude to which<br>
The tide of things has borne him, he appears<br>
To breathe and live but for himself alone,<br>
Unblamed, uninjured, let him bear about<br>
The good which the benignant law of Heaven<br>
Has hung around him: and, while life is his,<br>
Still let him prompt the unlettered villagers<br>
To tender offices and pensive thoughts.<br>
&mdash;Then let him pass, a blessing on his head!<br>
And, long as he can wander, let him breathe<br>
The freshness of the valleys; let his blood<br>
Struggle with frosty air and winter snows;<br>
And let the chartered wind that sweeps the heath<br>
Beat his grey locks against his withered face.<br>
Reverence the hope whose vital anxiousness<br>
Gives the last human interest to his heart.<br>
May never <b>House</b>, misnamed of <b>Industry</b>,<br>
Make him a captive!&mdash;for that pent-up din,<br>
Those life-consuming sounds that clog the air,<br>
Be his the natural silence of old age!<br>
Let him be free of mountain solitudes;<br>
And have around him, whether heard or not,<br>
The pleasant melody of woodland birds.<br>
Few are his pleasures: if his eyes have now<br>
Been doomed so long to settle upon earth<br>
That not without some effort they behold<br>
The countenance of the horizontal sun,<br>
Rising or setting, let the light at least<br>
Find a free entrance to their languid orbs.<br>
And let him, <i>where</i> and <i>when</i> he will, sit down<br>
Beneath the trees, or on a grassy bank<br>
Of highway side, and with the little birds<br>
Share his chance-gathered meal; and, finally,<br>
As in the eye of Nature he has lived,<br>
So in the eye of Nature let him die!</td>

In Verse.<br>
Taken During A<br>

In The<br>

<b>To the Rev. Robert Jones, Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.</b><br>
<br>
Dear sir, However desirous I might have been of giving you proofs of the
high place you hold in my esteem, I should have been cautious of
wounding your delicacy by thus publicly addressing you, had not the
circumstance of my having accompanied you amongst the Alps, seemed to
give this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any scruples
which your modesty might otherwise have suggested.<br>
<br>
In inscribing this little work to you I consult my heart. You know well
how great is the difference between two companions lolling in a post
chaise, and two travellers plodding slowly along the road, side by side,
each with his little knap-sack of necessaries upon his shoulders. How
much more of heart between the two latter!<br>
<br>
I am happy in being conscious I shall have one reader who will approach
the conclusion of these few pages with regret. You they must certainly
interest, in reminding you of moments to which you can hardly look back
without a pleasure not the less dear from a shade of melancholy. You
will meet with few images without recollecting the spot where we
observed them together, consequently, whatever is feeble in my design,
or spiritless in my colouring, will be amply supplied by your own
memory.<br>
<br>
With still greater propriety I might have inscribed to you a description
of some of the features of your native mountains, through which we have
wandered together, in the same manner, with so much pleasure. But the
sea-sunsets which give such splendour to the vale of Clwyd, Snowdon, the
chair of Idris, the quiet village of Bethkelert, Menai and her druids,
the Alpine steeps of the Conway, and the still more interesting windings
of the wizard stream of the Dee remain yet untouched. Apprehensive that
my pencil may never be exercised on these subjects, I cannot let slip
this opportunity of thus publicly assuring you with how much affection
and esteem,<br>
<br>
I am Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
Your most obedient very humble Servant<br>
<br>

<td>Were there, below, a spot of holy ground,<br>
By Pain and her sad family unfound,<br>
Sure, Nature's <b>God</b> that spot to man had giv'n,<br>
Where murmuring rivers join the song of ev'n;<br>
Where falls the purple morning far and wide<br>
In flakes of light upon the mountain-side;<br>
Where summer Suns in ocean sink to rest,<br>
Or moonlight Upland lifts her hoary breast;<br>
Where Silence, on her night of wing, o'er-broods<br>
Unfathom'd dells and undiscover'd woods;<br>
Where rocks and groves the power of waters shakes<br>
In cataracts, or sleeps in quiet lakes.<br><br>

But doubly pitying Nature loves to show'r<br>
Soft on his wounded heart her healing pow'r,<br>
Who plods o'er hills and vales his road forlorn,<br>
Wooing her varying charms from eve to morn.<br>
No sad vacuities his heart annoy,<br>
Blows not a Zephyr but it whispers joy;<br>
For him lost flowers their idle sweets exhale;<br>
He tastes the meanest note that swells the gale;<br>
For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn,<br>
And peeps the far-off spire, his evening bourn!<br>
Dear is the forest frowning o'er his head,<br>
And dear the green-sward to his velvet tread;<br>
Moves there a cloud o'er mid-day's flaming eye?<br>
Upward he looks&mdash;and calls it luxury;<br>
Kind Nature's charities his steps attend,<br>
In every babbling brook he finds a friend,<br>
While chast'ning thoughts of sweetest use, bestow'd<br>
By Wisdom, moralize his pensive road.<br>
Host of his welcome inn, the noon-tide bow'r,<br>
To his spare meal he calls the passing poor;<br>
He views the Sun uprear his golden fire,<br>
Or sink, with heart alive like Memnon's lyre;<br>
Blesses the Moon that comes with kindest ray<br>
To light him shaken by his viewless way.<br>
With bashful fear no cottage children steal<br>
From him, a brother at the cottage meal,<br>
His humble looks no shy restraint impart,<br>
Around him plays at will the virgin heart.<br>
While unsuspended wheels the village dance,<br>
The maidens eye him with inquiring glance,<br>
Much wondering what sad stroke of crazing Care<br>
Or desperate Love could lead a wanderer there.<br><br>

Me, lur'd by hope her sorrows to remove,<br>
A heart, that could not much itself approve,<br>
O'er Gallia's wastes of corn dejected led,<br>
Her road elms rustling thin above my head,<br>
Or through her truant pathway's native charms,<br>
By secret villages and lonely farms,<br>
To where the Alps, ascending white in air,<br>
Toy with the Sun, and glitter from afar.<br><br>

Ev'n now I sigh at hoary Chartreuse' doom<br>
Weeping beneath his chill of mountain gloom.<br>
Where now is fled that Power whose frown severe<br>
Tam'd "sober Reason" till she crouch'd in fear?<br>
That breath'd a death-like peace these woods around<br>
Broke only by th' unvaried torrent's sound,<br>
Or prayer-bell by the dull cicada drown'd.<br>
The cloister startles at the gleam of arms,<br>
And Blasphemy the shuddering fane alarms;<br>
Nod the cloud-piercing pines their troubl'd heads,<br>
Spires, rocks, and lawns, a browner night o'erspreads.<br>
Strong terror checks the female peasant's sighs,<br>
And start th' astonish'd shades at female eyes.<br>
The thundering tube the aged angler hears,<br>
And swells the groaning torrent with his tears.<br>
From Bruno's forest screams the frighted jay,<br>
And slow th' insulted eagle wheels away.<br>
The cross with hideous laughter Demons mock,<br>
By angels planted on the aëreal rock.<br>
The "parting Genius" sighs with hollow breath<br>
Along the mystic streams of Life and Death.<br>
Swelling the outcry dull, that long resounds<br>
Portentous, thro' her old woods' trackless bounds,<br>
Deepening her echoing torrents' awful peal<br>
And bidding paler shades her form conceal,<br>
Vallombre, mid her falling fanes, deplores,<br>
For ever broke, the sabbath of her bow'rs.<br><br>

More pleas'd, my foot the hidden margin roves<br>
Of Como bosom'd deep in chesnut groves.<br>
No meadows thrown between, the giddy steeps<br>
Tower, bare or sylvan, from the narrow deeps.<br>
To towns, whose shades of no rude sound complain,<br>
To ringing team unknown and grating wain,<br>
To flat-roof'd towns, that touch the water's bound,<br>
Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound,<br>
Or from the bending rocks obtrusive cling,<br>
And o'er the whiten'd wave their shadows fling;<br>
Wild round the steeps the little pathway twines,<br>
And Silence loves it's purple roof of vines.<br>
The viewless lingerer hence, at evening, sees<br>
From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees;<br>
Or marks, mid opening cliffs, fair dark-ey'd maids<br>
Tend the small harvest of their garden glades,<br>
Or, led by distant warbling notes, surveys,<br>
With hollow ringing ears and darkening gaze,<br>
Binding the charmed soul in powerless trance,<br>
Lip-dewing Song and ringlet-tossing Dance,<br>
Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume<br>
The bosom'd cabin's lyre-enliven'd gloom;<br>
Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view<br>
Stretch, o'er their pictur'd mirror, broad and blue,<br>
Tracking the yellow sun from steep to steep,<br>
As up th' opposing hills, with tortoise foot, they creep.<br>
Here half a village shines, in gold array'd,<br>
Bright as the moon, half hides itself in shade.<br>
From the dark sylvan roofs the restless spire<br>
Inconstant glancing, mounts like springing fire.<br>
There, all unshaded, blazing forests throw no<br>
Rich golden verdure on the waves below.<br>
Slow glides the sail along th' illumin'd shore,<br>
And steals into the shade the lazy oar.<br>
Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs,<br>
And amourous music on the water dies.<br>
Heedless how Pliny, musing here, survey'd<br>
Old Roman boats and figures thro' the shade,<br>
Pale Passion, overpower'd, retires and woos<br>
The thicket, where th' unlisten'd stock-dove coos.<br><br>

How bless'd, delicious Scene! the eye that greets<br>
Thy open beauties, or thy lone retreats;<br>
Th' unwearied sweep of wood thy cliffs that scales,<br>
The never-ending waters of thy vales;<br>
The cots, those dim religious groves enbow'r,<br>
Or, under rocks that from the water tow'r<br>
Insinuated, sprinkling all the shore,<br>
Each with his household boat beside the door,<br>
Whose flaccid sails in forms fantastic droop,<br>
Bright'ning the gloom where thick the forests stoop;<br>
&mdash;Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky,<br>
Thy towns, like swallows' nests that cleave on high;<br>
That glimmer hoar in eve's last light, descry'd<br>
Dim from the twilight water's shaggy side,<br>
Whence lutes and voices down th' enchanted woods<br>
Steal, and compose the oar-forgotten floods,<br>
While Evening's solemn bird melodious weeps,<br>
Heard, by star-spotted bays, beneath the steeps;<br>
&mdash;Thy lake, mid smoking woods, that blue and grey<br>
Gleams, streak'd or dappled, hid from morning's ray<br>
Slow-travelling down the western hills, to fold<br>
It's green-ting'd margin in a blaze of gold;<br>
From thickly-glittering spires the matin-bell<br>
Calling the woodman from his desert cell,<br>
A summons to the sound of oars, that pass,<br>
Spotting the steaming deeps, to early mass;<br>
Slow swells the service o'er the water born,<br>
While fill each pause the ringing woods of morn.<br><br>

Farewel! those forms that, in thy noon-tide shade,<br>
Rest, near their little plots of wheaten glade;<br>
Those stedfast eyes, that beating breasts inspire<br>
To throw the "sultry ray" of young Desire;<br>
Those lips, whose tides of fragrance come, and go,<br>
Accordant to the cheek's unquiet glow;<br>
Those shadowy breasts in love's soft light array'd,<br>
And rising, by the moon of passion sway'd.<br><br>

&mdash;Thy fragrant gales and lute-resounding streams,<br>
Breathe o'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams;<br>
While Slavery, forcing the sunk mind to dwell<br>
On joys that might disgrace the captive's cell,<br>
Her shameless timbrel shakes along thy marge,<br>
And winds between thine isles the vocal barge.<br><br>

Yet, arts are thine that rock th' unsleeping heart,<br>
And smiles to Solitude and Want impart.<br>
I lov'd, mid thy most desert woods astray,<br>
With pensive step to measure my slow way,<br>
By lonely, silent cottage-doors to roam,<br>
The far-off peasant's day-deserted home;<br>
Once did I pierce to where a cabin stood,<br>
The red-breast peace had bury'd it in wood,<br>
There, by the door a hoary-headed sire<br>
Touch'd with his wither'd hand an aged lyre;<br>
Beneath an old-grey oak as violets lie,<br>
Stretch'd at his feet with stedfast, upward eye,<br>
His children's children join'd the holy sound,<br>
A hermit&mdash;with his family around.<br><br>

Hence shall we seek where fair Locarno smiles<br>
Embower'd in walnut slopes and citron isles,<br>
Or charms that smile on Tusa's evening stream,<br>
While mid dim towers and woods her waters gleam;<br>
From the bright wave, in solemn gloom, retire<br>
The dull-red steeps, and darkening still, aspire,<br>
To where afar rich orange lustres glow<br>
Round undistinguish'd clouds, and rocks, and snow;<br>
Or, led where Viamala's chasms confine<br>
Th' indignant waters of the infant Rhine,<br>
Bend o'er th' abyss?&mdash;the else impervious gloom<br>
His burning eyes with fearful light illume.<br>
The Grison gypsey here her tent has plac'd,<br>
Sole human tenant of the piny waste;<br>
Her tawny skin, dark eyes, and glossy locks,<br>
Bend o'er the smoke that curls beneath the rocks.<br>
<br>
&mdash;The mind condemn'd, without reprieve, to go<br>
O'er life's long deserts with it's charge of woe,<br>
With sad congratulation joins the train,<br>
Where beasts and men together o'er the plain<br>
Move on,&mdash;a mighty caravan of pain;<br>
Hope, strength, and courage, social suffering brings,<br>
Freshening the waste of sand with shades and springs.<br><br>

&mdash;She solitary through the desert drear<br>
Spontaneous wanders, hand in hand with Fear.<br><br>

A giant moan along the forest swells<br>
Protracted, and the twilight storm foretells,<br>
And, ruining from the cliffs their deafening load<br>
Tumbles, the wildering Thunder slips abroad;<br>
On the high summits Darkness comes and goes,<br>
Hiding their fiery clouds, their rocks, and snows;<br>
The torrent, travers'd by the lustre broad,<br>
Starts like a horse beside the flashing road;<br>
In the roof'd bridge, at that despairing hour,<br>
She seeks a shelter from the battering show'r.<br>
&mdash;Fierce comes the river down; the crashing wood<br>
Gives way, and half it's pines torment the flood;<br>
Fearful, beneath, the Water-spirits call,<br>
And the bridge vibrates, tottering to its fall.<br><br>

&mdash;Heavy, and dull, and cloudy is the night,<br>
No star supplies the comfort of it's light,<br>
Glimmer the dim-lit Alps, dilated, round,<br>
And one sole light shifts in the vale profound;<br>
While, opposite, the waning moon hangs still,<br>
And red, above her melancholy hill.<br>
By the deep quiet gloom appall'd, she sighs,<br>
Stoops her sick head, and shuts her weary eyes.<br>
&mdash;Breaking th' ascending roar of desert floods,<br>
And insect buzz, that stuns the sultry woods,<br>
She hears, upon the mountain forest's brow,<br>
The death-dog, howling loud and long, below;<br>
On viewless fingers counts the valley-clock,<br>
Followed by drowsy crow of midnight cock.<br>
&mdash;Bursts from the troubl'd Larch's giant boughs<br>
The pie, and chattering breaks the night's repose.<br>
Low barks the fox; by Havoc rouz'd the bear,<br>
Quits, growling, the white bones that strew his lair;<br>
The dry leaves stir as with the serpent's walk,<br>
And, far beneath, Banditti voices talk;<br>
Behind her hill the Moon, all crimson, rides,<br>
And his red eyes the slinking Water hides;<br>
Then all is hush'd; the bushes rustle near,<br>
And with strange tinglings sings her fainting ear.<br>
&mdash;Vex'd by the darkness, from the piny gulf<br>
Ascending, nearer howls the famish'd wolf,<br>
While thro' the stillness scatters wild dismay,<br>
Her babe's small cry, that leads him to his prey.<br><br>

Now, passing Urseren's open vale serene,<br>
Her quiet streams, and hills of downy green,<br>
Plunge with the Russ embrown'd by Terror's breath,<br>
Where danger roofs the narrow walks of death;<br>
By floods, that, thundering from their dizzy height,<br>
Swell more gigantic on the stedfast sight;<br>
Black drizzling craggs, that beaten by the din,<br>
Vibrate, as if a voice complain'd within; <br>
Bare steeps, where Desolation stalks, afraid,<br>
Unstedfast, by a blasted yew upstay'd;<br>
By cells whose image, trembling as he prays,<br>
Awe-struck, the kneeling peasant scarce surveys;<br>
Loose-hanging rocks the Day's bless'd eye that hide,<br>
And crosses rear'd to Death on every side,<br>
Which with cold kiss Devotion planted near,<br>
And, bending, water'd with the human tear,<br>
Soon fading "silent" from her upward eye,<br>
Unmov'd with each rude form of Danger nigh,<br>
Fix'd on the anchor left by him who saves<br>
Alike in whelming snows and roaring waves.<br><br>

On as we move, a softer prospect opes,<br>
Calm huts, and lawns between, and sylvan slopes.<br>
While mists, suspended on th' expiring gale,<br>
Moveless o'er-hang the deep secluded vale,<br>
The beams of evening, slipping soft between,<br>
Light up of tranquil joy a sober scene;<br>
Winding it's dark-green wood and emerald glade,<br>
The still vale lengthens underneath the shade;<br>
While in soft gloom the scattering bowers recede,<br>
Green dewy lights adorn the freshen'd mead,<br>
Where solitary forms illumin'd stray<br>
Turning with quiet touch the valley's hay,<br>
On the low brown wood-huts delighted sleep<br>
Along the brighten'd gloom reposing deep.<br>
While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull,<br>
And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull,<br>
In solemn shapes before th' admiring eye<br>
Dilated hang the misty pines on high,<br>
Huge convent domes with pinnacles and tow'rs,<br>
And antique castles seen tho' drizzling show'rs.<br><br>

From such romantic dreams my sould awake,<br>
Lo! Fear looks silent down on Uri's lake,<br>
By whose unpathway'd margin still and dread<br>
Was never heard the plodding peasant's tread.<br>
Tower like a wall the naked rocks, or reach<br>
Far o'er the secret water dark with beech,<br>
More high, to where creation seems to end,<br>
Shade above shade the desert pines ascend,<br>
And still, below, where mid the savage scene <br>
Peeps out a little speck of smilgin green,<br>
There with his infants man undaunted creeps<br>
And hangs his small wood-hut upon the steeps.<br>
A garden-plot the desert air perfumes,<br>
Mid the dark pines a little orchard blooms,<br>
A zig-zag path from the domestic skiff<br>
Threading the painful cragg surmounts the cliff.<br>
&mdash;Before those hermit doors, that never know<br>
The face of traveller passing to and fro,<br>
No peasant leans upon his pole, to tell<br>
For whom at morning toll'd the funeral bell,<br>
Their watch-dog ne'er his angry bark forgoes,<br>
Touch'd by the beggar's moan of human woes,<br>
The grass seat beneath their casement shade<br>
The pilgrim's wistful eye hath never stay'd.<br>
&mdash;There, did the iron Genius not disdain<br>
The gentle Power that haunts the myrtle plain,<br>
There might the love-sick maiden sit, and chide<br>
Th' insuperable rocks and severing tide,<br>
There watch at eve her lover's sun-gilt sail<br>
Approaching, and upbraid the tardy gale,<br>
There list at midnight till is heard no more,<br>
Below, the echo of his parting oar,<br>
There hang in fear, when growls the frozen stream,<br>
To guide his dangerous tread the taper's gleam.<br><br>

Mid stormy vapours ever driving by,<br>
Where ospreys, cormorants, and herons cry,<br>
Where hardly giv'n the hopeless waste to chear,<br>
Deny'd the bread of life the foodful ear,<br>
Dwindles the pear on autumn's latest spray,<br>
And apple sickens pale in summer's ray,<br>
Ev'n here Content has fix'd her smiling reign<br>
With Independance child of high Disdain.<br>
Exulting mid the winter of the skies,<br>
Shy as the jealous chamois, Freedom flies,<br>
And often grasps her sword, and often eyes,<br>
Her crest a bough of Winter's bleakest pine,<br>
Strange "weeds" and alpine plants her helm entwine,<br>
And wildly-pausing oft she hangs aghast,<br>
While thrills the "Spartan fife" between the blast.<br>
  <br>
'Tis storm; and hid in mist from hour to hour<br>
All day the floods a deeper murmur pour,<br>
And mournful sounds, as of a Spirit lost,<br>
Pipe wild along the hollow-blustering coast,<br>
'Till the Sun walking on his western field<br>
Shakes from behind the clouds his flashing shield.<br>
Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,<br>
Glances the fire-clad eagle's wheeling form;<br>
Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine<br>
The wood-crown'd cliffs that o'er the lake recline;<br>
Wide o'er the Alps a hundred streams unfold,<br>
At once to pillars turn'd that flame with gold;<br>
Behind his sail the peasant strives to shun<br>
The west that burns like one dilated sun,<br>
Where in a mighty crucible expire<br>
The mountains, glowing hot, like coals of fire.<br><br>

But lo! the boatman, over-aw'd, before<br>
The pictur'd fane of Tell suspends his oar;<br>
Confused the Marathonian tale appears,<br>
While burn in his full eyes the glorious tears.<br>
And who but feels a power of strong controul,<br>
Felt only there, oppress his labouring soul,<br>
Who walks, where honour'd men of ancient days<br>
Have wrought with god-like arm the deeds of praise?<br>
Say, who, by thinking on Canadian hills,<br>
Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills,<br>
On Zutphen's plain; or where with soften'd gaze<br>
The old grey stones the plaided chief surveys,<br>
Can guess the high resolve, the cherish'd pain<br>
Of him whom passion rivets to the plain,<br>
Where breath'd the gale that caught Wolfe's happiest sigh,<br>
And the last sun-beam fell on Bayard's eye,<br>
Where bleeding Sydney from the cup retir'd,<br>
And glad Dundee in "faint huzzas" expir'd.<br>
 <br>
But now with other soul I stand alone<br>
Sublime upon this far-surveying cone,<br>
And watch from pike to pike amid the sky<br>
Small as a bird the chamois-chaser fly.<br>
'Tis his with fearless step at large to roam<br>
Thro' wastes, of Spirits wing'd the solemn home,<br>
Thro' vacant worlds where Nature never gave<br>
A brook to murmur or a bough to wave,<br>
Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep;<br>
Thro' worlds where Life and Sound, and Motion sleep,<br>
Where Silence still her death-like reign extends,<br>
Save when the startling cliff unfrequent rends:<br>
In the deep snow the mighty ruin drown'd,<br>
Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound;<br>
&mdash;To mark a planet's pomp and steady light<br>
In the least star of scarce-appearing night,<br>
And neighbouring moon, that coasts the vast profound,<br>
Wheel pale and silent her diminish'd round,<br>
While far and wide the icy summits blaze<br>
Rejoicing in the glory of her rays;<br>
The star of noon that glitters small and bright,<br>
Shorn of his beams, insufferably white,<br>
And flying fleet behind his orb to view<br>
Th' interminable sea of sable blue.<br>
&mdash;Of cloudless suns no more ye frost-built spires<br>
Refract in rainbow hues the restless fires!<br>
Ye dewy mists the arid rocks o'er-spread<br>
Whose slippery face derides his deathful tread!<br><br>

&mdash;To wet the peak's impracticable sides<br>
He opens of his feet the sanguine tides, <br>
Weak and more weak the issuing current eyes<br>
Lapp'd by the panting tongue of thirsty skies.<br>
&mdash;At once bewildering mists around him close,<br>
And cold and hunger are his least of woes;<br>
The Demon of the snow with angry roar <br>
Descending, shuts for aye his prison door.<br>
Craz'd by the strength of hope at morn he eyes<br>
As sent from heav'n the raven of the skies,<br>
Then with despair's whole weight his spirits sink,<br>
No bread to feed him, and the snow his drink, <br>
While ere his eyes can close upon the day,<br>
The eagle of the Alps o'ershades his prey.<br>
&mdash;Meanwhile his wife and child with cruel hope<br>
All night the door at every moment ope;<br>
Haply that child in fearful doubt may gaze,<br>
Passing his father's bones in future days,<br>
Start at the reliques of that very thigh,<br>
On which so oft he prattled when a boy.<br>
  <br>
Hence shall we turn where, heard with fear afar,<br>
Thunders thro' echoing pines the headlong Aar? <br>
Or rather stay to taste the mild delights<br>
Of pensive Underwalden's pastoral heights?<br>
  <br>
&mdash;Is there who mid these awful wilds has seen<br>
The native Genii walk the mountain green?<br>
Or heard, while other worlds their charms reveal, <br>
Soft music from th' aëreal summit steal?<br>
While o'er the desert, answering every close,<br>
Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes.<br>
&mdash;And sure there is a secret Power that reigns<br>
Here, where no trace of man the spot profanes, <br>
Nought but the herds that pasturing upward creep,<br>
Hung dim-discover'd from the dangerous steep,<br>
Or summer hamlet, flat and bare, on high<br>
Suspended, mid the quiet of the sky.<br><br>

How still! no irreligious sound or sight<br>
Rouzes the soul from her severe delight.<br>
An idle voice the sabbath region fills<br>
Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills,<br>
Broke only by the melancholy sound<br>
Of drowsy bells for ever tinkling round;<br>
Faint wail of eagle melting into blue<br>
Beneath the cliffs, and pine-woods steady sugh;<br>
The solitary heifer's deepen'd low;<br>
Or rumbling heard remote of falling snow.<br>
Save that, the stranger seen below, the boy<br>
Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy.<br><br>

When warm from myrtle bays and tranquil seas,<br>
Comes on, to whisper hope, the vernal breeze,<br>
When hums the mountain bee in May's glad ear,<br>
And emerald isles to spot the heights appear,<br>
When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill,<br>
And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill,<br>
When fragrant scents beneath th' enchanted tread<br>
Spring up, his little all around him spread,<br>
The pastoral Swiss begins the cliffs to scale<br>
To silence leaving the deserted vale,<br>
Up the green mountain tracking Summer's feet,<br>
Each twilight earlier call'd the Sun to meet,<br>
With earlier smile the ray of morn to view<br>
Fall on his shifting hut that gleams mid smoking dew;<br>
Bless'd with his herds, as in the patriarch's age,<br>
The summer long to feed from stage to stage;<br>
O'er azure pikes serene and still, they go,<br>
And hear the rattling thunder far below;<br>
Or lost at eve in sudden mist the day<br>
Attend, or dare with minute-steps their way;<br>
Hang from the rocks that tremble o'er the steep,<br>
And tempt the icy valley yawning deep,<br>
O'er-walk the chasmy torrent's foam-lit bed,<br>
Rock'd on the dizzy larch's narrow tread,<br>
Whence Danger leans, and pointing ghastly, joys<br>
To mock the mind with "desperation's toys";<br>
Or steal beneath loose mountains, half deterr'd,<br>
That sigh and shudder to the lowing herd.<br>
&mdash;I see him, up the midway cliff he creeps <br>
To where a scanty knot of verdure peeps,<br>
Thence down the steep a pile of grass he throws<br>
The fodder of his herds in winter snows.<br>
Far different life to what tradition hoar<br>
Transmits of days more bless'd in times of yore.<br>
Then Summer lengthen'd out his season bland,<br>
And with rock-honey flow'd the happy land.<br>
Continual fountains welling chear'd the waste,<br>
And plants were wholesome, now of deadly taste.<br>
Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had pil'd <br>
Usurping where the fairest herbage smil'd;<br>
Nor Hunger forc'd the herds from pastures bare<br>
For scanty food the treacherous cliffs to dare.<br>
Then the milk-thistle bad those herds demand<br>
Three times a day the pail and welcome hand. <br>
But human vices have provok'd the rod<br>
Of angry Nature to avenge her God.<br>
Thus does the father to his sons relate,<br>
On the lone mountain top, their chang'd estate.<br>
Still, Nature, ever just, to him imparts <br>
Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts.<br>
&mdash;'Tis morn: with gold the verdant mountain glows,<br>
More high, the snowy peaks with hues of rose.<br>
Far stretch'd beneath the many-tinted hills<br>
A mighty waste of mist the valley fills, <br>
A solemn sea! whose vales and mountains round<br>
Stand motionless, to awful silence bound.<br>
A gulf of gloomy blue, that opens wide<br>
And bottomless, divides the midway tide.<br>
Like leaning masts of stranded ships appear <br>
The pines that near the coast their summits rear;<br>
Of cabins, woods, and lawns a pleasant shore<br>
Bounds calm and clear the chaos still and hoar;<br>
Loud thro' that midway gulf ascending, sound<br>
Unnumber'd streams with hollow roar profound.<br>
Mounts thro' the nearer mist the chaunt of birds,<br>
And talking voices, and the low of herds,<br>
The bark of dogs, the drowsy tinkling bell,<br>
And wild-wood mountain lutes of saddest swell.<br>
Think not, suspended from the cliff on high<br>
He looks below with undelighted eye.<br>
&mdash;No vulgar joy is his, at even tide<br>
Stretch'd on the scented mountain's purple side.<br>
For as the pleasures of his simple day<br>
Beyond his native valley hardly stray,<br>
Nought round it's darling precincts can he find<br>
But brings some past enjoyment to his mind,<br>
While Hope that ceaseless leans on Pleasure's urn<br>
Binds her wild wreathes, and whispers his return.<br><br>

Once Man entirely free, alone and wild,<br>
Was bless'd as free&mdash;for he was Nature's child.<br>
He, all superior but his God disdain'd,<br>
Walk'd none restraining, and by none restrain'd,<br>
Confess'd no law but what his reason taught,<br>
Did all he wish'd, and wish'd but what he ought.<br>
As Man in his primaeval dower array'd<br>
The image of his glorious sire display'd,<br>
Ev'n so, by vestal Nature guarded, here<br>
The traces of primaeval Man appear.<br>
The native dignity no forms debase,<br>
The eye sublime, and surly lion-grace.<br>
The slave of none, of beasts alone the lord,<br>
He marches with his flute, his book, and sword,<br>
Well taught by that to feel his rights, prepar'd<br>
With this "the blessings he enjoys to guard."<br>
  <br>
And as on glorious ground he draws his breath,<br>
Where Freedom oft, with Victory and Death,<br>
Hath seen in grim array amid their Storms<br>
Mix'd with auxiliar Rocks, three hundred Forms;<br>
While twice ten thousand corselets at the view<br>
Dropp'd loud at once, Oppression shriek'd, and flew.<br>
Oft as those sainted Rocks before him spread,<br>
An unknown power connects him with the dead.<br>
For images of other worlds are there,<br>
Awful the light, and holy is the air.<br>
Uncertain thro' his fierce uncultur'd soul<br>
Like lighted tempests troubled transports roll;<br>
To viewless realms his Spirit towers amain,<br>
Beyond the senses and their little reign.<br>
  <br>
And oft, when pass'd that solemn vision by,<br>
He holds with God himself communion high,<br>
When the dread peal of swelling torrents fills<br>
The sky-roof'd temple of th' eternal hills,<br>
And savage Nature humbly joins the rite,<br>
While flash her upward eyes severe delight.<br>
Or gazing from the mountain's silent brow,<br>
Bright stars of ice and azure worlds of snow,<br>
Where needle peaks of granite shooting bare<br>
Tremble in ever-varying tints of air,<br>
Great joy by horror tam'd dilates his heart,<br>
And the near heav'ns their own delights impart.<br>
&mdash;When the Sun bids the gorgeous scene farewell,<br>
Alps overlooking Alps their state upswell;<br>
Huge Pikes of Darkness nam'd, of Fear and Storms<br>
Lift, all serene, their still, illumin'd forms,<br>
In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread,<br>
Ting'd like an angel's smile all rosy red.<br>
  <br>
When downward to his winter hut he goes,<br>
Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows,<br>
That hut which from the hills his eyes employs<br>
So oft, the central point of all his joys.<br>
And as a swift by tender cares oppress'd<br>
Peeps often ere she dart into her nest,<br>
So to th' untrodden floor, where round him looks<br>
His father helpless as the babe he rocks,<br>
Oft he descends to nurse the brother pair,<br>
Till storm and driving ice blockade him there;<br>
There hears, protected by the woods behind,<br>
Secure, the chiding of the baffled wind,<br>
Hears Winter, calling all his Terrors round,<br>
Rush down the living rocks with whirlwind sound.<br><br>

Thro' Nature's vale his homely pleasures glide<br>
Unstain'd by envy, discontent, and pride,<br>
The bound of all his vanity to deck<br>
With one bright bell a favourite heifer's neck;<br>
Content upon some simple annual feast,<br>
Remember'd half the year, and hop'd the rest,<br>
If dairy produce, from his inner hoard,<br>
Of thrice ten summers consecrate the board.<br>
&mdash;Alas! in every clime a flying ray<br>
Is all we have to chear our wintry way,<br>
Condemn'd, in mists and tempests ever rife,<br>
To pant slow up the endless Alp of life.<br>
"Here," cried a swain, whose venerable head<br>
Bloom'd with the snow-drops of Man's narrow bed,<br>
Last night, while by his dying fire, as clos'd<br>
The day, in luxury my limbs repos'd,<br>
"Here Penury oft from misery's mount will guide<br>
Ev'n to the summer door his icy tide,<br>
And here the avalanche of Death destroy<br>
The little cottage of domestic Joy.<br>
But, ah! th' unwilling mind may more than trace<br>
The general sorrows of the human race:<br>
The churlish gales, that unremitting blow<br>
Cold from necessity's continual snow,<br>
To us the gentle groups of bliss deny<br>
That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie.<br>
Yet more; the tyrant Genius, still at strife<br>
With all the tender Charities of life,<br>
When close and closer they begin to strain,<br>
No fond hand left to staunch th' unclosing vein,<br>
Tearing their bleeding ties leaves Age to groan<br>
On his wet bed, abandon'd and alone.<br>
For ever, fast as they of strength become<br>
To pay the filial debt, for food to roam,<br>
The father, forc'd by Powers that only deign<br>
That solitary Man disturb their reign,<br>
From his bare nest amid the storms of heaven<br>
Drives, eagle-like, his sons as he was driven,<br>
His last dread pleasure! watches to the plain&mdash;<br>
And never, eagle-like, beholds again."<br>
  <br>
When the poor heart has all its joys resign'd,<br>
Why does their sad remembrance cleave behind?<br>
Lo! by the lazy Seine the exile roves,<br>
Or where thick sails illume Batavia's groves;<br>
Soft o'er the waters mournful measures swell,<br>
Unlocking bleeding Thought's "memorial cell";<br>
At once upon his heart Despair has set<br>
Her seal, the mortal tear his cheek has wet;<br>
Strong poison not a form of steel can brave<br>
Bows his young hairs with sorrow to the grave.<br>
  Gay lark of hope thy silent song resume!<br>
Fair smiling lights the purpled hills illume!<br>
Soft gales and dews of life's delicious morn,<br>
And thou, lost fragrance of the heart return!<br>
Soon flies the little joy to man allow'd,<br>
And tears before him travel like a cloud.<br>
For come Diseases on, and Penury's rage,<br>
Labour, and Pain, and Grief, and joyless Age,<br>
And Conscience dogging close his bleeding way<br>
Cries out, and leads her Spectres to their prey,<br>
'Till Hope-deserted, long in vain his breath<br>
Implores the dreadful untried sleep of Death.<br>
&mdash;Mid savage rocks and seas of snow that shine<br>
Between interminable tracts of pine,<br>
Round a lone fane the human Genii mourn,<br>
Where fierce the rays of woe collected burn.<br>
&mdash;From viewless lamps a ghastly dimness falls,<br>
And ebbs uncertain on the troubled walls,<br>
Dim dreadful faces thro' the gloom appear,<br>
Abortive Joy, and Hope that works in fear,<br>
While strives a secret Power to hush the crowd,<br>
Pain's wild rebellious burst proclaims her rights aloud.<br>
  Oh give not me that eye of hard disdain<br>
That views undimm'd Einsiedlen's wretched fane.<br>
Mid muttering prayers all sounds of torment meet,<br>
Dire clap of hands, distracted chafe of feet,<br>
While loud and dull ascends the weeping cry,<br>
Surely in other thoughts contempt may die.<br>
If the sad grave of human ignorance bear<br>
One flower of hope&mdash;Oh pass and leave it there.<br><br>

&mdash;The tall Sun, tiptoe on an Alpine spire,<br>
Flings o'er the desert blood-red streams of fire.<br>
At such an hour there are who love to stray,<br>
And meet the gladdening pilgrims on their way.<br>
&mdash;Now with joy's tearful kiss each other greet,<br>
Nor longer naked be your way-worn feet,<br>
For ye have reach'd at last that happy shore,<br>
Where the charm'd worm of pain shall gnaw no more.<br>
How gayly murmur and how sweetly taste<br>
The fountains rear'd for you amid the waste!<br>
Yes I will see you when ye first behold<br>
Those turrets tipp'd by hope with morning gold,<br>
And watch, while on your brows the cross ye make,<br>
Round your pale eyes a wintry lustre wake.<br>
&mdash;Without one hope her written griefs to blot,<br>
Save in the land where all things are forgot,<br>
My heart, alive to transports long unknown,<br>
Half wishes your delusion were it's own.<br>
  <br>
Last let us turn to where Chamouny shields,<br>
Bosom'd in gloomy woods, her golden fields,<br>
Five streams of ice amid her cots descend,<br>
And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend,<br>
A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns<br>
Of purple lights and ever vernal plains.<br>
Here lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fann'd,<br>
Here all the Seasons revel hand in hand,<br>
&mdash;Red stream the cottage lights; the landscape fades,<br>
Erroneous wavering mid the twilight shades.<br>
Alone ascends that mountain nam'd of white,<br>
That dallies with the Sun the summer night.<br>
Six thousand years amid his lonely bounds<br>
The voice of Ruin, day and night, resounds.<br>
Where Horror-led his sea of ice assails,<br>
Havoc and Chaos blast a thousand vales,<br>
In waves, like two enormous serpents, wind<br>
And drag their length of deluge train behind.<br>
Between the pines enormous boughs descry'd<br>
Serene he towers, in deepest purple dy'd;<br>
Glad Day-light laughs upon his top of snow,<br>
Glitter the stars above, and all is black below.<br>
  <br>
At such an hour I heav'd the human sigh,<br>
When roar'd the sullen Arve in anger by,<br>
That not for thee, delicious vale! unfold<br>
Thy reddening orchards, and thy fields of gold;<br>
That thou, the slave of slaves, art doom'd to pine,<br>
While no Italian arts their charms combine<br>
To teach the skirt of thy dark cloud to shine;<br>
For thy poor babes that, hurrying from the door,<br>
With pale-blue hands, and eyes that fix'd implore,<br>
Dead muttering lips, and hair of hungry white,<br>
Besiege the traveller whom they half affright.<br>
&mdash;Yes, were it mine, the cottage meal to share<br>
Forc'd from my native mountains bleak and bare;<br>
O'er Anet's hopeless seas of marsh to stray,<br>
Her shrill winds roaring round my lonely way;<br>
To scent the sweets of Piedmont's breathing rose,<br>
And orange gale that o'er Lugano blows;<br>
In the wide range of many a weary round,<br>
Still have my pilgrim feet unfailing found,<br>
As despot courts their blaze of gems display,<br>
Ev'n by the secret cottage far away<br>
The lilly of domestic joy decay;<br>
While Freedom's farthest hamlets blessings share,<br>
Found still beneath her smile, and only there.<br>
The casement shade more luscious woodbine binds,<br>
And to the door a neater pathway winds,<br>
At early morn the careful housewife, led<br>
To cull her dinner from it's garden bed,<br>
Of weedless herbs a healthier prospect sees,<br>
While hum with busier joy her happy bees;<br>
In brighter rows her table wealth aspires,<br>
And laugh with merrier blaze her evening fires;<br>
Her infant's cheeks with fresher roses glow,<br>
And wilder graces sport around their brow;<br>
By clearer taper lit a cleanlier board<br>
Receives at supper hour her tempting hoard;<br>
The chamber hearth with fresher boughs is spread,<br>
And whiter is the hospitable bed.<br><br>

&mdash;And thou! fair favoured region! which my soul<br>
Shall love, till Life has broke her golden bowl,<br>
Till Death's cold touch her cistern-wheel assail,<br>
And vain regret and vain desire shall fail;<br>
Tho' now, where erst the grey-clad peasant stray'd,<br>
To break the quiet of the village shade <br>
Gleam war's discordant habits thro' the trees,<br>
And the red banner mock the sullen breeze;<br>
Tho' now no more thy maids their voices suit<br>
To the low-warbled breath of twilight lute,<br>
And heard, the pausing village hum between,<br>
No solemn songstress lull the fading green,<br>
Scared by the fife, and rumbling drum's alarms,<br>
And the short thunder, and the flash of arms;<br>
While, as Night bids the startling uproar die,<br>
Sole sound, the sourd renews his mournful cry:<br>
&mdash;Yet, hast thou found that Freedom spreads her pow'r<br>
Beyond the cottage hearth, the cottage door:<br>
All nature smiles; and owns beneath her eyes<br>
Her fields peculiar, and peculiar skies.<br>
Yes, as I roam'd where Loiret's waters glide<br>
Thro' rustling aspins heard from side to side,<br>
When from October clouds a milder light<br>
Fell, where the blue flood rippled into white,<br>
Methought from every cot the watchful bird<br>
Crowed with ear-piercing power 'till then unheard;<br>
Each clacking mill, that broke the murmuring streams,<br>
Rock'd the charm'd thought in more delightful dreams;<br>
Chasing those long long dreams the falling leaf<br>
Awoke a fainter pang of moral grief;<br>
The measured echo of the distant flail<br>
Winded in sweeter cadence down the vale;<br>
A more majestic tide the water roll'd,<br>
And glowed the sun-gilt groves in richer gold:<br>
  <br>
&mdash;Tho' Liberty shall soon, indignant, raise<br>
Red on his hills his beacon's comet blaze;<br>
Bid from on high his lonely cannon sound,<br>
And on ten thousand hearths his shout rebound;<br>
His larum-bell from village-tow'r to tow'r<br>
Swing on th' astounded ear it's dull undying roar:<br>
Yet, yet rejoice, tho' Pride's perverted ire<br>
Rouze Hell's own aid, and wrap thy hills in fire.<br>
Lo! from th' innocuous flames, a lovely birth!<br>
With it's own Virtues springs another earth:<br>
Nature, as in her prime, her virgin reign<br>
Begins, and Love and Truth compose her train;<br>
With pulseless hand, and fix'd unwearied gaze,<br>
Unbreathing Justice her still beam surveys:<br>
No more, along thy vales and viny groves,<br>
Whole hamlets disappearing as he moves,<br>
With cheeks o'erspread by smiles of baleful glow,<br>
On his pale horse shall fell Consumption go.<br>
  <br>
Oh give, great God, to Freedom's waves to ride<br>
Sublime o'er Conquest, Avarice, and Pride,<br>
To break, the vales where Death with Famine scow'rs,<br>
And dark Oppression builds her thick-ribb'd tow'rs;<br>
Where Machination her fell soul resigns,<br>
Fled panting to the centre of her mines;<br>
Where Persecution decks with ghastly smiles<br>
Her bed, his mountains mad Ambition piles;<br>
Where Discord stalks dilating, every hour,<br>
And crouching fearful at the feet of Pow'r,<br>
Like Lightnings eager for th' almighty word,<br>
Look up for sign of havoc, Fire, and Sword;<br>
&mdash;Give them, beneath their breast while Gladness springs,<br>
To brood the nations o'er with Nile-like wings;<br>
And grant that every sceptred child of clay,<br>
Who cries, presumptuous, "here their tides shall stay,"<br>
Swept in their anger from th' affrighted shore,<br>
With all his creatures sink&mdash;to rise no more.<br>
  To-night, my friend, within this humble cot<br>
Be the dead load of mortal ills forgot,<br>
Renewing, when the rosy summits glow<br>
At morn, our various journey, sad and slow.</td>

he must chuse the evening, as it is on the western side of the Lake. We

<a name="29O"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote O:</span></a> &nbsp; I had once given to these sketches the title of
Picturesque; but the Alps are insulted in applying to them that term.
Whoever, in attempting to describe their sublime features, should
confine himself to the cold rules of painting would give his reader but
a very imperfect idea of those emotions which they have the irresistible
power of communicating to the most impassive imaginations. The fact is,
that controuling influence, which distinguishes the Alps from all other
scenery, is derived from images which disdain the pencil. Had I wished
to make a picture of this scene I had thrown much less light into it.
But I consulted nature and my feelings. The ideas excited by the stormy
sunset I am here describing owed their sublimity to that deluge of
light, or rather of fire, in which nature had wrapped the immense forms
around me; any intrusion of shade, by destroying the unity of the
impression, had necessarily diminished its grandeur.<br>

<a name="29Q"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote Q:</span></a> &nbsp; For most of the images in the next sixteen verses I am
indebted to M. Raymond's interesting observations annexed to his
translation of Coxe's <i>Tour in Switzerland</i>.<br>
<a href="#fr29Q">return</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="29R"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote R:</span></a> &nbsp; The rays of the sun drying the rocks frequently produce on
their surface a dust so subtile and slippery, that the wretched
chamois-chasers are obliged to bleed themselves in the legs and feet in
order to secure a footing.<br>

melancholy disposition than the other inhabitants of the Alps: this, if
true, may proceed from their living more secluded.<br>
<a href="#fr29S">return</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="29T"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote T:</span></a> &nbsp; These summer hamlets are most probably (as I have seen
observed by a critic in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>) what Virgil alludes

of the Italians.<br>
<a href="#fr29V">return</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="29W"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote W:</span></a> &nbsp;This tradition of the golden age of the Alps, as M. Raymond
observes, is highly interesting, interesting not less to the philosopher
than to the poet. Here I cannot help remarking, that the superstitions
of the Alps appear to be far from possessing that poetical character
which so eminently distinguishes those of Scotland and the other
mountainous northern countries. The Devil with his horns, etc., seems to
be in their idea, the principal agent that brings about the sublime
natural revolutions that take place daily before their eyes.<br>

<a name="29X"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote X:</span></a> &nbsp; Alluding to several battles which the Swiss in very small
numbers have gained over their oppressors the house of Austria; and in
particular, to one fought at Naeffels near Glarus, where three hundred
and thirty men defeated an army of between fifteen and twenty thousand
Austrians. Scattered over the valley are to be found eleven stones, with
this inscription, 1388, the year the battle was fought, marking out as I
was told upon the spot, the several places where the Austrians
attempting to make a stand were repulsed anew.<br>

<br>
<a name="29Z"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote Z:</span></a> &nbsp; The effect of the famous air called in French Ranz des
Vaches upon the Swiss troops removed from their native country is well
known, as also the injunction of not playing it on pain of death, before
the regiments of that nation, in the service of France and Holland.<br>

these sheds the sentimental traveller and the philosopher may find
interesting sources of meditation.<br>

taken the liberty of reading it long thinking it more musical.<br>
<a href="#fr29Dd">return</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="29Ee"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote Ee:</span></a> &nbsp; It is only from the higher part of the valley of Chàmouny
that Mont Blanc is visible.<br>

<a name="29Ff"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote Ff:</span></a> &nbsp; It is scarce necessary to observe that these lines were
written before the emancipation of Savoy.<br>

<a name="29Gg"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote Gg:</span></a> &nbsp; A vast extent of marsh so called near the lake of
Neuf-chatel.<br>

<a name="29Hh"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote Hh:</span></a> &nbsp; This, as may be supposed, was written before France became
the seat of war.<br>

<br>
<br>
<a name="29Ii"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote Ii:</span></a> &nbsp; An insect so called, which emits a short, melancholy cry,
heard, at the close of the summer evenings, on the banks of the Loire.<br>
<a href="#fr29Ii">return</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="29Jj"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote Jj:</span></a> &nbsp;The river Loiret, which has the honour of giving name to a
department, rises out of the earth at a place, called La Source, a
league and a half south-east of Orleans, and taking at once the
character of a considerable stream, winds under a most delicious bank on
its left, with a flat country of meadows, woods, and vineyards on its
right, till it falls into the Loire about three or four leagues below
Orleans. The hand of false taste has committed on its banks those
outrages which the Abbé de Lille so pathetically deprecates in those
charming verses descriptive of the Seine, visiting in secret the retreat
of his friend Watelet. Much as the Loiret, in its short course, suffers
from injudicious ornament, yet are there spots to be found upon its
banks as soothing as meditation could wish for: the curious traveller
may meet with some of them where it loses itself among the mills in the
neighbourhood of the villa called La Fontaine. The walks of La Source,
where it takes its rise, may, in the eyes of some people, derive an
additional interest from the recollection that they were the retreat of
Bolingbroke during his exile, and that here it was that his
philosophical works were chiefly composed. The inscriptions, of which he
speaks in one of his letters to Swift descriptive of this spot, are not,
I believe, now extant. The gardens have been modelled within these
twenty years according to a plan evidently not dictated by the taste of
the friend of Pope.<br>
<a href="#fr29Jj">return</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="29Kk"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote Kk:</span></a> &nbsp; The duties upon many parts of the French rivers were so
exorbitant that the poorer people, deprived of the benefit of water
carriage, were obliged to transport their goods by land.<br>

The pedestrians bought a boat at Basle, and in it floated down the Rhine
as far as Cologne, intending to proceed in the same way to Ostend; but
they returned to England from Cologne by Calais. In the course of this
tour, Wordsworth wrote a letter to his sister, dated "Sept. 6, 1790,
Keswill, a small village on the Lake of Constance," which will be found
amongst his letters in a subsequent volume.&mdash;Ed.<br>

<i>Simon Lee</i><br>
<br>
It was found impossible fully to describe, within the limits of a
footnote, the endless shiftings to and fro of the stanzas and half
stanzas of 'Simon Lee'. The first eight stanzas of the edition of 1798
are therefore reprinted in this Appendix; and a Table is added, by means
of which the various transpositions effected from time to time may be
readily ascertained. In the Table 'a' stands for lines 1-4, and 'b' for
lines 5-8 of a stanza.<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>


<blockquote>In the sweet shire of Cardigan,<br>
Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall,<br>
An old man dwells, a little man,<br>
I've heard he once was tall.<br>
Of years he has upon his back,<br>
No doubt, a burthen weighty;<br>
He says he is three score and ten,<br>
But others say he's eighty.<br><br>

A long blue livery-coat has he,<br>
That's fair behind, and fair before;<br>
Yet, meet him where you will, you see<br>
At once that he is poor.<br>
Full five and twenty years he lived<br>
A running huntsman merry;<br>
And, though he has but one eye left,<br>
His cheek is like a cherry.<br><br>

No man like him the horn could sound,<br>
And no man was so full of glee;<br>
To say the least, four counties round<br>
Had heard of Simon Lee;<br>
His master's dead, and no one now<br>
Dwells in the hall of Ivor;<br>
Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead;<br>
He is the sole survivor.<br><br>

His hunting feats have him bereft<br>
Of his right eye, as you may see:<br>
And then, what limbs those feats have left<br>
To poor old Simon Lee!<br>
He has no son, he has no child,<br>
His wife, an aged woman,<br>
Lives with him, near the waterfall,<br>
Upon the village common.<br><br>

And he is lean and he is sick,<br>
His little body's half awry<br>
His ancles they are swoln and thick;<br>
His legs are thin and dry.<br>
When he was young he little knew<br>
Of husbandry or tillage;<br>
And now he's forced to work, though weak,<br>
&mdash;The weakest in the village.<br><br>

He all the country could outrun,<br>
Could leave both man and horse behind;<br>
And often, ere the race was done,<br>
He reeled and was stone-blind.<br>
And still there's something in the world<br>
At which his heart rejoices;<br>
For when the chiming hounds are out,<br>
He dearly loves their voices!<br><br>

Old Ruth works out of doors with him,<br>
And does what Simon cannot do;<br>
For she, not over stout of limb,<br>
Is stouter of the two.<br>
And though you with your utmost skill<br>
From labour could not wean them,<br>
Alas! 'tis very little, all<br>
Which they can do between them.<br><br>

Beside their moss-grown hut of clay,<br>
Not twenty paces from the door,<br>
A scrap of land they have, but they<br>
Are poorest of the poor.<br>
This scrap of land he from the heath<br>
Enclosed when he was stronger;<br>
But what avails the land to them,<br>
Which they can till no longer?</blockquote><br>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
